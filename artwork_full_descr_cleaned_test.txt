Marina Cruz has created a large nominal Painting on Oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 In many ways what Cruz does is to render the clothes in miniature but on the scale of large painting This miniaturist sensibility implicates the ways by which she references domestic life that is largely inhabited by women sheltered by women clothed by women And so home and woman form a robust context here as it had been in her previous sorties But what this new series introduces is age the ageing of both cloth and woman It is in this ambience that painting investigates and cites traces of attrition of the material It is likewise in this atmosphere that the artist tries to imagine the childhood for instance of her mother of how history has intervened to transform the body into something else The comparison between the child and the mother intrigues her This is a telling pause of remembrance because it is evoked by some kind of a shell a mold of an erstwhile body that has overcome the confinement And yet the vessel persists to serve as an index of the presence It is this index that Cruz paints an index that is further dissipated by adornment and the evidence of wear and tear

Miriam Cahn has created a small cheap Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1997.0 Influenced by performance art and the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s Cahn developed her work in the 1980s incorporating large black and rich drawings of warships televisions fighter jets and other seemingly male dominated vernacular Back then she was often using her body to instrumentalize the drawing in a perfomative act The performative aspect is just as valid as the corporeality with which her work develops The body is not only the subject of contemplation but also serves the artist as a medium Here the artist reshapes seen images as mental images in a medium appropriate for the portrayal which transports and accentuates her own view of matters Miriam Cahn came to international prominence with three successive and unprecedented opportunities an inclusion in Documenta 7 in 1982 in which she removed her work out of protest a solo show at Kunsthalle Basel curated by director Jean Christophe Ammann in 1983 and a solo presentation at the 41st Venice Biennale in 1984 representing her country of Switzerland Decades later at age 50 she made a radical move in her practice when she decided to leave the monumental drawings in which she became known for an equally intuitive painting practice This move was a direct evolution and innovation of the result of 30 years of drawing and performing Cahn began using color in 1994 turned on to the formal and psychological power of mass media imagery and its gradual saturation She cites Michelangelo Antonioni s 1964 film Il deserto rosso Red Desert as a work that exposed her to the hyper reality of color With exquisite sensitivity Cahn uses color to highlight choice parts of her figures principally breasts lips or eyes suggesting fragility and fecundity and endowing her figures with a sense of inner life Over the last couple of decades Cahn s extraordinary range and iconography have been supported by the emotive potential of painting focusing on the body human conflict home war nature and landscape both real and imagined are frequent themes

Margarete Jakschik has created a medium   Photography on color photograph in the modern year of 2020.0 PLACEHOLDER SIMILAR WORKOften the perfect moment presents itself as something ambivalent As something that can be felt but cannot be captured in language and through its description it literally loses the aura out of whose facets it is assembled in our thoughts And yet it is something tangible that manifests itself in our perceptions and feelings The perfect moment can be found in many things in the unnoticed shaking of the plumage of a bird whose feathers almost tangibly overlap in their softness In the breaking open of an almost threateningly darkened sky in which the reflections of the sun s rays promise the feeling of hope Or in the familiar radiance of a tree whose silhouette appears in the pleasant light of the waning day against the approaching red of dusk Margarete Jakschik s photographs are not created as part of a specific project or in series but access the poetry of everyday life like found moments over the course of an indefinite period of time Charged with memories of places or people in their atmospheric colorfulness they speak softly and almost inaudibly of our relationships to past situations and the experiences found in them Of moments that are preserved in our thoughts and continually branch out anew with our own associations like an invisible web Sensitive and multifaceted similar to the wet strands of hair extending down a child s back like the soft tentacles of an octopus reminiscent in their sharp contrast of Karl Blossfeldt s sensitive plant photographs Taken in Los Angeles a city of dreams and constant change Jakschik s photographs pause in the documentation of her everyday life and equally direct our gaze on the uncontrived poetry of a landscape that makes America a place of longing honest and unadorned in the coexistence of its contrasts To a place that does not exist purely on the basis of artificially projected ideas but in relation to our memories and emotions offered to it However far from a working method that directly aims for attribution or identification of photographic categories in their form as a depiction Jakschik s works become portraits Not in the conventional sense since her photographs which in their momentary nature do not always directly focus on the depiction of a person instead capture the atmosphere of a certain moment A feeling that is primal and comes from deep within us and connects us with what is depicted The surreal and comforting absurdity of watching a bear bathing feeling the cool expanse of an extending valley and the deep serenity of a walk together in whose beauty a portrait of Jakschik s own view on and of things is also depicted Unburdened by the latest technical advancements of photography and far from all its new possibilities of manipulation but always with the goal of openly and equally allowing vulnerability strength and feeling in the sensitive light of her snapshots 
Tosh Basco has created a small   Photography on C-Print mounted on aluminium (Unique) in the modern year of 2021.0 Portraits Still Lifes and Flowers Tosh Basco s most recent solo show at Carlos Ishikawa is the first iteration of the ongoing and evolving body of Tosh Basco s photographic practice Gathered from a never before seen collection of Basco s intimate chronicle of daily life these snapshots function as a record of a specific moment in the artist s complex relationship to cameras Limiting the selection of images to the context of the past two years Basco printed and piled hundreds of stills shot on film and re photographed them resulting in the twelve unique pieces which comprise this show Flattened within the frame like pressed flowers Basco describes the stacks of photos being like memory banks in which everything is touching rubbing into everything else dancing and disappearing and reappearing like electrons in an atom coming in and out of focus First learning to shoot manually with an AE 1 CANON a gift to the artist as a 15 year old from her father photography has consistently defined the shape of Basco s life and work as a performer in more ways than one In an audio piece which accompanies the show Basco says photography brought me to performance I learned the stage from the frame photography taught me the frame the frame and the stage are the same The images in Portraits Still Lifes and Flowers both reveal and obscure the movement of time and the fear that comes when witnessing the passing of life With a gentle tone and joyful touch Basco s pictures of domestic life in a pandemic seem simple at first But as the disconnected frames are viewed together a loved one wrapped in a wrinkled blanket flowers wilting in a garbage bag an indifferent seascape an anonymous room etc the nostalgia of pictures reminiscent of family photos peels away at the genre to show a more somber point of view The works presented in Portraits Still Lifes and Flowers are the first act of a life long photographic project A testament of humbling ambition and scale devoted to documenting the in between moments of Basco s life and constantly changing relationship to the camera Basco s gaze as a photographer is preoccupied with death and loss The pattern that emerges in Portraits Still Lifes and Flowers reflects a morbidity that is very real and deeply relevant The fact that these photos were made at the cusp of and during a period of historically significant isolation feels important Basco s pictures from this period of just before and during the pandemic are touching and unsettling at once The images may be extremely personal but like many subjective expressions they also speak to a more universal experience and broadly shared human urge to protest against forgetting Most people know me through my performance practice but don t know the depth that photography has always informed that practice The stage and the camera and the frame are all deeply entrenched with the act of looking and seeing Between these two aspects I am also able to reflect on the delicate space between This space being one that is in constant oscillation between life and death Life and death dance and surround There is then always the question of the ways we encounter life with what quality are certain people granted access to living and the counterpart of the ways in which life is taken and for which uses or gain This work tries to use the constraints of distance to think about other ways of connecting a portrait and memento of a love that has changed form It is has death folded many times into it and in acknowledging that glows with moments of joy that make life worth living Tosh Basco 2020 adapted from the text for M M S 1 Creator Projects Copenhagen Tosh Basco s b 1988 USA practice encompasses performance photography and drawing Her improvisational movement based work under the name boychild arose from the underground drag scene in San Francisco She is co founder of the collaborative entity Moved by the Motion with Wu Tsang Moved by the Motion will be performing Orpheus at Schauspielhaus Z rich During Art Basel

Florian Baudrexel has created a medium   Sculpture on cardboard, wood, acrylic glass box in the modern year of 2021.0 Mounted in square Plexiglas boxes the sculptures articulate their own distilled formal language Their overlapping surfaces form levels cascades and edges The individual elements are concentrated with suggested movements like a barely perceptible echo of modernist architecture and the compositional complexes combine to form dynamic centers The raw haptic qualities of their edges and corners make them almost tangible and create a volume that like the direct result of a constant change in the surfaces lends them an immediate and tactile impression Made from colored cardboard boxes Baudrexel s Cardbirds also visualize the moment of finding a form and with it the immersion in a previously unconscious world It is a world composed of spaces that are hidden behind the edges and breaks of their innumerable constituent parts and allow our eyes to explore the soft colors of their material like an expansive landscape Their contours which result from the found abstract and architectural elements of the cardboard boxes as well as from the materiality of their breaks are layered to form new architectures They clearly outline the model like figures that Baudrexel developed in the open interplay of their internal and external form and simultaneously visualize the facets of their process based development the sketch like capturing of a formal idea the multitude of their components which initially unfolded on the table and pinboard and at the same time the freedom of a playful moment This occurs unexpectedly and easily amid everyday life and concentrated in a silent dialogue in which their forms and structures are both an offer and an invitation to enrich them with our associations and impressions Like the forms new spaces open up in them and in them an exchange about the fragility of beauty in the lightness of a specially created world

Marlene Dumas has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 2011.0 Learn more about Marlene Dumas Marlene Dumas b 1953 is widely regarded as one of the most influential painters working today Over the past four decades she has continuously probed the complexities of identity and representation in her work Born in Cape Town South Africa in 1953 Dumas moved to Amsterdam in 1976 where she has since lived and worked Her paintings and drawings frequently devoted to depictions of the human form are typically culled from a vast archive of images collected by the artist including art historical materials mass media sources and personal snapshots of friends and family Gestural fluid and frequently spectral Dumas s works reframe and recontextualize her subjects exploring the ambiguous and shifting boundaries between public and private selves The present painting is from a group of works that Dumas debuted at her 2011 solo exhibition at Frith Street Gallery London In a short text for the catalogue Dumas wrote about the concept of the exhibition and the works This is an exhibition that takes the words of Christ on the cross as its starting point The moment of feeling utterly and absolutely alone when he cried out My God why has thou forsaken me It is not an exhibition only about the dilemmas of Christianity but also about the loss of love and beliefs that we have forsaken It is about tragic lives and falls from grace It is about portraits betraying states of mind About people becoming ghosts of themselves 1Solo is one of four paintings from this group depicting Christ on the cross at Golgotha Writing about the depictions of Christ Dumas notes The monotheistic notion of only one God that cannot be seen directly is shared by Judaism Christianity and Islam Therefore images of Him are problematic or totally taboo Christianity however introduced Jesus and a God that sacrifices his son A large part of the history of painting is about depicting the dilemma of body and soul through the images of Christ on the cross The existential doubt of whether what one believes in is true and even worth dying for is the basis of this show be it religion art or love 2Here Dumas isolates her depiction of Christ who appears on the crucifix against a diffuse white background The long narrow support reinforces the sense of the figure s isolation and gives the canvas itself a human like presence Christ s wan sagging body recalls the crucifixion scene in Matthias Gr newald s Isenheim Altarpiece 1515 1516 as well as countless other Old Master depictions of Christ on the cross 1 Marlene Dumas Forsaken Exh cat London Frith Street Gallery 2012 n p 2 Ibid 
Francis Picabia has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on board on canvas in the classic year of 1943.0 Learn more about Francis Picabia As one of the most acclaimed figures in twentieth century art Francis Picabia 1879 1953 created a unique and prolific body of work comprising painting poetry drawing and graphic design Although Picabia made important contributions to Cubism Dada and Surrealism he refused to dedicate himself to a single way of working throughout his career As the artist wrote in 1923 What I like is to invent to imagine to make myself at every moment a new man and then to forget him to forget everything 1 His quest for invention challenges viewers to as Anne Umland writes think differently about the history of modern art in a way that is more open ended messier nonbinary one that challenges distinctions between good and bad progressive and regressive sincerity and parody high art and kitsch 2 In the early 1940s Picabia was living in the south of France The Nazi occupation of northern France and the repressive Vichy regime in the south made life difficult for avant garde artists who struggled to produce and sell their art The present work which was created during this time is representative of what art historians later referred to as Picabia s kitsch period in which he made works primarily depicting women that he met or that were derived from images of movie stars or from pictures he found in erotic magazines As Alison M Gingeras curator of the celebrated 2002 2003 traveling exhibition Dear Painter Paint Me which featured Femme nue devant la glace notes of this period Beginning with Francis Picabia s late nudes from the early 1940s the question of painting as a filter of mass media s impact on both individual and collective sense of identity has emerged as a key preoccupation of artists in the postwar period These notorious paintings shunned for their regression into realism and their embrace of kitsch drew their pictorial source from tawdry black and white photographs culled from soft core pornography magazines While the invention of photo illustrated magazines did not occur in tandem with Picabia s late realist paintings their infiltration of everyday life coincided with the postwar years The increased circulation of these magazines served not only as an anesthetizing agent to numb wartime suffering but actively shaped the identity construction of a new social corpus 3 By complicating the traditional genre of the female nude with lowbrow mass media source material Picabia continued his Dada era practice of critiquing art and modern society and also foreshadowed the concerns of Pop Art 1 Francis Picabia Francis Merci Litt rature nouvelle s rie no 8 January 1923 p 16 17 2 Anne Umland Francis Picabia An Introduction in Francis Picabia Our Heads Are Round So Our Thoughts Can Change Direction New York and Zurich The Museum of Modern Art and Kunsthalle Zurich 2016 p 13 3 Alison M Gingeras Lieber Maler male mir in Dear Painter paint me Painting the Figure since late Picabia Exh cat Paris Centre Pompidou 2002 p 12 
Robert Ryman has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 2003.0 Learn more about Robert Ryman American artist Robert Ryman 1930 2019 is widely celebrated for his tactile monochromatic works which he executed using a range of painterly media on various supports including paper canvas linen aluminum vinyl and newsprint Emerging in the 1960s Ryman eschewed self contained representational and abstract imagery instead giving precedence to the physical gesture of applying paint to a support Unlike many of the artists and movements with which he is often associated such as abstract expressionism and minimalism labels to which he never subscribed Ryman neither reveled in the emotive qualities of gesturalism nor sought to eradicate the painterly mark rather his works are novel and sensitive explorations of the visual material and experiential qualities of his media that exist in a dialogue with their surroundings His lifelong commitment to working in shades of white and off white served as a means of enhancing the specific and the mutable in the experience of his art calling further attention to the nuances that distinguished one composition from another and also drawing associations to conceptual art practices Throughout Ryman s sustained exploration of the physical properties of painting he has sought to avoid symbolic or representational associations instead calling attention to process and materiality As Naomi Spector noted in 1974 Ryman ceased to use paint to make something that could be seen at all apart from the paint itself Now the work was about the nature of paint the paint was the content of the paintings as well as the form They had no meaning outside the paint and the supporting material and the history of the process of the application 1Series 11 White features subtle yet distinct tones of white over a dark ground that emerges at the edges of the support The work belongs to a group of paintings first shown in 2004 that expressly focus on the color white as subject matter As the artist has written White as subject was a different approach for me The danger would be not to make the painting feel like a picture of white white as subject but to incorporate the white and the dark ground as one The decision to paint the color white opened up some new problems as to how I could go about doing it I thought of using a dark ground in order to project the white as color which also allows the white to be used compositionally To give myself range I basically used four different whites in the paintings although this is not discernible except possibly under different lighting conditions In using the four whites I felt I would have to work the paint Usually I never work paint as I prefer to put paint down and leave it as is and in doing so generally like to use heavy paint But in working paint it needed to be of a lean consistency so it could be moved easily So of course that means a different application For the base structure of the paintings I decided on many different size canvases I like to work on different size paintings at the same time because it is more interesting and I have to shift my focus to a different scale With the large canvases I wanted them to have a relatively thin edge and project them away from the wall plane about two inches In that way the paintings have a more open feeling but still involve the wall aesthetically I use the sides of the paintings compositionally since the paintings themselves are the subject They are different when viewed from the left or the right side obliquely or from the front face During the process of painting I will view them from both sides and move them from one wall to another wall in order to see the paintings under different conditions Also at times I will change the height as I always paint them on a wall since a wall is necessary for the paintings to be complete I spend time looking at the paintings under different lighting conditions as my paintings work differently with changes of light The paintings change with daylight direct incandescent light and reflected incandescent light Reflected light is in some ways the best as it brings out all the nuance of the painting but it is a light in which it is almost never seen To identify the paintings I titled them Series White white in parentheses in order to differentiate them from my other white paintings 2Series 11 White was featured in a gallery devoted to Ryman s work at the 52nd Venice Biennale Think with the Senses Feel with the Mind in 2007 organized by curator Robert Storr Series 16 White 2003 another work from this series is in the collection of the Seattle Art Museum This work will be included in the forthcoming Robert Ryman catalogue raisonn as number 03 011 1 Naomi Spector Robert Ryman Exh cat Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum 1974 p 9 2 Robert Ryman in Robert Ryman Exh cat New York PaceWildenstein 2004 np

Bernard Frize has created a large expensive Painting on Acrylic and resin on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Tola is rendered in acrylic and resin Thick brushstrokes in jewel tones are layered across the canvas in a lattice formation leaving no trace as to which mark met the canvas first Following a carefully choreographed method the horizontal and vertical strokes interweave across the painting generating a powerful sense of illusionistic depth which is then further enhanced by the remarkable variations of hue present in each stroke alone Curiously although the brushwork appears viscous the combination of acrylic paint and synthetic resin renders the canvas surface almost mechanically flat bestowing it with a texture that has become a hallmark of Frize s practice 
Lucy McKenzie has created a small expensive Mixed Media on oil on canvas, wood, plasterboard, metal, glass in the modern year of 2019.0 Lucy McKenzie staged her large hidden mural Giving Up The Shadows On My Face as if it had just been found beneath a false wall It is a replica of the mural on display in the central reading room of the Russian State Library in Moscow But McKenzie has reinterpreted it loosening up its repressive sexuality and illustrating the private lives of individuals outside of Soviet ideals Each time the painting is installed a different aspect of the work is revealed but never in its totality The burial of the work and its recovery situates it in an endless deferral of complete or coherent readings of the image countering the spectatorship and the spectacle associated with the monumental References to buried histories the seduction of the fragment archaeology and the opacity of the subject are deployed The work is accompanied by a series of trompe l oeil paintings installed in display vitrines that function as further contextual information reproducing source material for the work However rather than being an overt explanation of the content the material is more personalized playing further with the public private themes of the installation as a whole Lucy McKenzie born 1977 in Glasgow combines traditional oil painting with a variety of other disciplines in her work including collaborations in fashion and furniture design curation writing and publishing She has been represented by Cabinet since 1999 McKenzie lives and works in Brussels

Jina Park has created a medium cheap Painting on Oil on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Jina Park employs snapshots to capture scenes of the everyday and translates them onto the canvas as paintings Portraying the colorful expressions of exhibition installation sites performance rehearsals and nighttime sceneries the platform of paintings allows the audience to look back on the otherwise unnoticed or forgotten mundane life anew Park captures ordinary moments of the un choreographed every day Casual moments that are in no way significant are permanently documented by the camera Someone s unique facial expression or another s awkward posture is captured in the process by chance At times the artist discovers a figure whom she had not even been aware of during the instant caught in the photograph The camera is a means for the artist to see and perceive what she otherwise would not be able to the camera is the artist s glasses through which she observes the world for Park its role extends no further The camera serves solely to capture and document the images of these transit moments Simply defining painting as both an image and a material Park focuses on its unique materiality As her working process concentrates on repetitive physical contact with the canvas the transient moment captured by chance with the camera is reconstructed on the canvas over a prolonged period of time The fleeting moment that could have been easily bypassed dons a new materiality and temporality One figure may repeatedly appear in various works while another figure may appear numerous times within a single frame Sometimes multiple photographs are rearranged into one composition As such Park s paintings are the products of combining images from various timelines through her own painterly perspective 
Antonio Tarsis has created a small cheap Other Materials on Guarany Fósforos de Seguarança matchbox balsa wood and paper in the modern year of 2021.0 O c u em peda os Sky in pieces Antonio Tarsis originally began this series by collecting matchboxes that had been used and thrown away in the streets of Salvador These are manufactured by a popular brand and found widespread across households in Brazil Much cheaper than a lighter the discarded matchboxes are pervasive in areas where drug dependency is high Hand assembled yet mass produced the materiality of these objects reacts easily when exposed to the elements recording traces of sunlight and water Tarsis employs the boxes as colour and symbol reconfiguring aligning or accentuating parts to compose collages with the tonalities creating new images suggestive of a painting a landscape an abstraction There is an immediate overlay a crossing of memories between the object s intrinsic meanings and the image suggested by the reorganization of its pieces There is a concise simplicity in Tarsis s act of reconstituting visual affective and social memory or personal and collective identity through this modest object The incendiary potential is transformed into a constructive space The discourse around the displacement of the everyday object can easily empty it of its less explicit meanings Tarsis is not interested in using objects to desecrate art to explore the reverse of their utility or in their mere removal from everyday contexts His work is a labour of collecting individualizing colors and dismantling to give new order to urban fragments The result of this process is a profound re signification The artist s work dignifies the fragments and the matchboxes are elevated to another scale of meaning not to counterpose their original use but as an acknowledgement of the material culture of a contemporary society in which an industrial and popular object intercedes something as primitive as fire Translated and adapted from the original Portuguese by Pedro Nery Museu de Arte Moderna de S o Paulo 2021
Daniel Boyd has created a medium nominal Painting on Oil, charcoal and archival glue on canvas  in the modern year of 2021.0 Through his art Daniel Boyd has continuously questioned the hegemonic Western gaze in interpreting Australian history and has challenged typical notions of perception Boyd continues to cover much of his paintings with clear convex dots of glue applied directly onto the canvas which act as lenses through which one views the world The artist explains that they are about perception and how we collectively understand something about plurality or multiplicity Each dot conveys and visualizes the calculated information between black and white darkness and light The opaque negative space in between implies a lost history or knowledge in this way the viewer understands the work in actively connecting the domains between the positive and the negative and realigning the viewpoints between the past and present Boyd s works connect time and space wherein the viewer must recognize the space and relationship between him herself and others and explore multiplicity by acknowledging these differences

Christoph Schellberg has created a small   Painting on Acrylic on belgian linen in the modern year of 2021.0 This painting is a work from a new series of paintings Centered by the boundaries of the canvas and the frames specially made for them Schellberg s works focus our gaze on their interior and with it on a principle of becoming and changing based on conscious decisions in which painting arises in the moments in which what is created extends beyond what is familiar to us In these smaller scaled works layers and streaks subtly overlap to form almost floating pictorial bodies Held within their frames they give space to our impressions and sensations and point to an inner almost hidden life of the paintings and to things that shine through and insights that like traces of a previous character only reveal themselves to our gaze as we draw closer to them Surfaces or lines that seem like the remains of a chance event dissolve almost completely before our eyes as a result of constant change and as visible relics reflect the creative process of the individual works as well as the sensitivity of our perception which lends the underlying layers and surfaces the appearance of the distant silhouette of an ephemeral landscape 
Carmen D´Apollonio has created a large nominal Sculpture on bronze in the modern year of 2021.0 Experiencing sculptures is like a sensorial journey feeling with our eyes and perceiving with our hands But it is also a projection in which our thoughts and associations are inscribed in their forms and attempt to grasp the multilayered facets of their characteristics from a first impression In Carmen D Apollonio s sculptural lamps and potheads the latter seem to expand almost surreally at the moment they are viewed Their bodies appear warm supple and elegant under their own light and convey a feeling of calm and composure yet also an almost incomprehensible atmosphere that becomes tangible in in moments of total well being as on one of those comfortable almost careless afternoons that we all too fondly remember and in which the structure of forms seems to come to life in the refractions of light as if miraculously and almost unconsciously D Apollonio grew up as the child of Italian parents outside Zurich has been co founder and co designer of the Swiss fashion label Ikou Tsch ss since 2006 and has lived in Los Angeles since 2014 In its alternation between design object functional lamp and designed sculpture D Apollonio s new series also refers to a sensation whose visual equivalent is tangibly evident in the various surfaces of her works matt and radiant as if their reclining bodies were filled with light that comes directly from within them This bronze pothead is the so far largest bronze pothead the artist so far has made It is a cast after the artists first ever made pothead 
Margarete Jakschik has created a small   Photography on color photograph in the modern year of 2020.0 PLACEHOLDER SIMILAR WORKOften the perfect moment presents itself as something ambivalent As something that can be felt but cannot be captured in language and through its description it literally loses the aura out of whose facets it is assembled in our thoughts And yet it is something tangible that manifests itself in our perceptions and feelings The perfect moment can be found in many things in the unnoticed shaking of the plumage of a bird whose feathers almost tangibly overlap in their softness In the breaking open of an almost threateningly darkened sky in which the reflections of the sun s rays promise the feeling of hope Or in the familiar radiance of a tree whose silhouette appears in the pleasant light of the waning day against the approaching red of dusk Margarete Jakschik s photographs are not created as part of a specific project or in series but access the poetry of everyday life like found moments over the course of an indefinite period of time Charged with memories of places or people in their atmospheric colorfulness they speak softly and almost inaudibly of our relationships to past situations and the experiences found in them Of moments that are preserved in our thoughts and continually branch out anew with our own associations like an invisible web Sensitive and multifaceted similar to the wet strands of hair extending down a child s back like the soft tentacles of an octopus reminiscent in their sharp contrast of Karl Blossfeldt s sensitive plant photographs Taken in Los Angeles a city of dreams and constant change Jakschik s photographs pause in the documentation of her everyday life and equally direct our gaze on the uncontrived poetry of a landscape that makes America a place of longing honest and unadorned in the coexistence of its contrasts To a place that does not exist purely on the basis of artificially projected ideas but in relation to our memories and emotions offered to it However far from a working method that directly aims for attribution or identification of photographic categories in their form as a depiction Jakschik s works become portraits Not in the conventional sense since her photographs which in their momentary nature do not always directly focus on the depiction of a person instead capture the atmosphere of a certain moment A feeling that is primal and comes from deep within us and connects us with what is depicted The surreal and comforting absurdity of watching a bear bathing feeling the cool expanse of an extending valley and the deep serenity of a walk together in whose beauty a portrait of Jakschik s own view on and of things is also depicted Unburdened by the latest technical advancements of photography and far from all its new possibilities of manipulation but always with the goal of openly and equally allowing vulnerability strength and feeling in the sensitive light of her snapshots

Sonia Boyce has created a large expensive Photography on Black and white photograph mounted on Dibond in the classic year of 1997.0  When I was in Cuba I was writing a lot about my dreams which were nonsensical and fecund The writing which translated into drawing was prompted by an incident in a hotel in Havana during the Biennale where a security guard mistook me for a prostitute simply for the fact that I was a woman of African descent in the hotel In my attempts to communicate with the guard I kept saying I don t speak Spanish On my return back to the UK the way I processed this experience was to ask four people if they would let me photograph the undersides of their tongues as if their ability to speak was stuck The piece became Tongues Sonia Boyce
Nari Ward has created a small expensive Mixed Media on Copper sheets, copper nails, darkening patina, oak frame; 366 × 914 cm; Weight: 680 kg in the modern year of 2021.0 A Brief History of Known takes the healing and resilient powers of copper as its medium The diamond shaped patterns refer to a Congolese cosmogram an ancient prayer symbol representing the cycle of birth life death and rebirth Nari Ward first saw this symbol at the First African Baptist Church in Savannah Georgia punctured into the floorboards and used as breathing holes for escaped slaves traveling the Underground Railroad Critically considering which histories are told and which remain unacknowledged Ward conceived the work as a type of history painting The iPhone case impressions are a nod to the use of technology in bearing witness while many shoe prints imply a large group of people suggesting a protest The abstract quality and range of blue tones suggest water and the ability to cleanse obscure and absorb Drawing a poetic line across centuries of world history the work is a monument to events of the past and the present Nari Ward born 1963 in St Andrew Jamaica uses discarded material in his thought provoking installations most often collected in his neighborhood By re contextualizing found objects he confronts history and issues surrounding race poverty and consumer culture Ward lives and works in New York

Dennis Kardon has created a small cheap Painting on Oil on linen in the modern year of 2022.0 Kardon artworks embrace the preoccupation with giving the viewer an experience of discomfiting intimacy pushing objects claustrophobically close to the picture plane Ordinary objects such as a bed lamp and a clock permeate the bright composition almost levitating and forced in the frame creating a suspended and metaphysical dimension which causes a strong sense of disorientation in the viewer By cutting the image enlarging its details and disconnecting it from its context the artist emphasizes the symbolic meaning of the scene and its deeper and mysterious contents This work has been inspired by a Jasper Johns s take on Munch s Between the Clock and the Bed painting

Christoph Schellberg has created a small   Painting on Acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 PLACEHOLDER SIMILAR WORKThis painting is a work from a new series of paintings Centered by the boundaries of the canvas and the frames specially made for them Schellberg s works focus our gaze on their interior and with it on a principle of becoming and changing based on conscious decisions in which painting arises in the moments in which what is created extends beyond what is familiar to us In these smaller scaled works layers and streaks subtly overlap to form almost floating pictorial bodies Held within their frames they give space to our impressions and sensations and point to an inner almost hidden life of the paintings and to things that shine through and insights that like traces of a previous character only reveal themselves to our gaze as we draw closer to them Surfaces or lines that seem like the remains of a chance event dissolve almost completely before our eyes as a result of constant change and as visible relics reflect the creative process of the individual works as well as the sensitivity of our perception which lends the underlying layers and surfaces the appearance of the distant silhouette of an ephemeral landscape 
Carmen D´Apollonio has created a large cheap Sculpture on ceramic, linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Experiencing sculptures is like a sensorial journey feeling with our eyes and perceiving with our hands But it is also a projection in which our thoughts and associations are inscribed in their forms and attempt to grasp the multilayered facets of their characteristics from a first impression In Carmen D Apollonio s sculptural lamps the latter seem to expand almost surreally at the moment they are viewed Their bodies appear warm supple and elegant under their own light and convey a feeling of calm and composure yet also an almost incomprehensible atmosphere that becomes tangible in in moments of total well being as on one of those comfortable almost careless afternoons that we all too fondly remember and in which the structure of forms seems to come to life in the refractions of light as if miraculously and almost unconsciously D Apollonio grew up as the child of Italian parents outside Zurich has been co founder and co designer of the Swiss fashion label Ikou Tsch ss since 2006 and has lived in Los Angeles since 2014 In its alternation between design object functional lamp and designed sculpture D Apollonio s new series also refers to a sensation whose visual equivalent is tangibly evident in the various surfaces of her works matt and radiant as if their reclining bodies were filled with light that comes directly from within them They also have a fine silver sheen which dignifiedly grants their arms and legs between figuration and abstract composition the qualities of a secret logic that only seems to be visible at the moment of its fleeting appearance The underlying bodies of D Apollonio s lamps are transformed in the firing as well as in the glazing process and yet are both the result of an almost unpredictable coincidental process as well as signs of origins that lend them almost human features They recline gently and seem to be calmly enjoying their inherent leisure like a companion whose presence we do not immediately feel yet is certain to us

Florian Baudrexel has created a large nominal Installation on Cardboard on wooden frame in the modern year of 2021.0 PLACEHOLDER SIMILAR WORKAs dense accumulations of geometrical elements of cardboard clay or other simple or waste materials Florian Baudrexel s work push towards the spectator at eye level They claim a physical dialogue aswell as they build a spiritual dimension Their model are the icons of the classical modern art Baudrexel uses the pictorial language of the early 20th century by carefully balancing the composition of abstract shapes and combining them to a coherent ensemble melting temperament and ratio into symbiotic entities that describe an energized abeyance between painting and sculpture His treatment of material goes back to the compositonial sensitivity of constructivism as it was examined by artists like Wladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodtschenko At the same time the dynamism of the arrangements remind of the loud pictorial language of the futurists of Giacomo Ballas or Boccionis bursting figures and exstatic arrangements Yet Baudrexel does not copy the achievements of his predecessors as he tries to modify and transmit them into an artistic language of the 21 century not without an ironic distance Thats how Baudrexel does not keep away aspects of figurative association from his work but even seek for a sort of rethoric speaking of the abstract forms Thus the bare shape has the potential to mutate to a figure and vice versa Gesine Borcherdt from the catalogue Abstract Art Now Strictly geometrical Theresa Kiefer and Linda von Mengden Hrsg Ludwigshafen

Marion Baruch has created a small cheap Mixed Media on polyester veil in the modern year of 2021.0 The Linguaggio delle forme series 2021 consists of framed offcuts that likewise speak of humanity s past and present These works deploy the archetypal vocabulary of abstract art its geometric forms and gestural marks As such they sum up years of artistic experimentation bearing out Baruch s contention that in abstract art the same formal vocabulary is endlessly recombined At the same time Baruch gives her recombinations a novel twist the negative or empty shapes in the fabric are so large and expansive that they move into the foreground leaving the bits of leftover material to recede into the background This suggests a less top down less hierarchical approach to making art where emptiness absence and non interference prevail over intention form giving or presence In the same way Baruch refrains from cutting altering or disfiguring the remnants she selects and instead acknowledges and respects them just as they are In Marion Baruch s fabric works recurring or archetypal forms generate an artistic language that is read written and spoken in new more inclusive and open ended ways a language where fabric becomes a writing instrument voids become legible and leftovers have their say

Manish Nai has created a small   Photography on Pigment Print on Hahnemuhle Paper in the modern year of 2021.0 As Manish Nai and the photographer Anil Rane scoured the expressway linking Bombay and Pune for vacant billboards a new series was born in his mind In periods when no commercial use was being made of billboards in the early 2010 they often advertised contact details of the firm that rented them out The phone numbers would usually be painted by hand in huge lettering When the space was leased the panels would be taken down only to be reused later as supports Since they were not visible in their role as backing material the panels would be placed in random order scrambling the numbers and letters painted on them Finally when the new advertisements came down the scrambled panels would be Revealed When photographed without reference to their context these billboards appear like ciphers enigmatic bits of code incomplete messages composed in that archetypal form of modernist abstraction the grid Rosalind Krauss in her seminal essay on the grid refers to it as a paradigm or model for the antidevelopmental the antinarrative the antihistorical Manish s grids in contrast open out to narrative and history Those unaware of their context sense the existence of a story behind the images while those who know the story find new puzzles in the decontextualized images They are to reiterate photographs of paintings that have in the course of removal from their utilitarian function as conveyors of a message been accidentally reconfigured to resemble paintings from a tradition with no utilitarian function modernist abstraction and been introduced into that second tradition by the artist who recognised the happy accident His photographs paradoxically acquire a place within the history of painterly abstraction that paintings would have been hard pressed to gain He achieves this just as he does with sculptures and works in jute on canvas through a profound receptivity to his physical surroundings and a process of sublimating and elevating humble source materials and mediums Excerpt from Manish Nai Capturing Time by Girish Shahane 2018 Published by the Het Noordbrabants Museum

Richard Serra has created a small expensive Work on Paper on Oilstick and charcoal on paper laid down on canvas in the classic year of 1972.0 The Metropolitan Museum of Art which has several drawings by the artist in its collection has noted Renowned as a maker of large scale often site specific sculptures Richard Serra has throughout his career also produced drawings that are at once independent from and deeply tied to his three dimensional work Since the early 1970s Serra has used black oil stick compressed tubes of paint pigment and wax to make drawings that like his sculptures strive to explore the limits of the medium and engage the viewer s phenomenological experience of the work 1The present work is one of Serra s process oriented drawings of the early 1970s In these drawings which precede the larger scaled installation drawings of the mid 1970s the artist s early experimentation with materials form and medium is readily evident Untitled 1972 also calls to mind much of the artist s sculpture of the late 1960s and early 1970s specifically mirroring the formal language and tensions of his c 1968 Props Not only do the square above and circle below echo the square metal plates and round lead or steel rolls in Serra s perfectly counterbalanced Props the present work on paper like the artist s sculpture makes apparent and even makes subject the process by which it was made Here the artist s gesture is left raw visible and dynamic especially along the lower outlines of the square black field and the black rubbings throughout which seem to suggest that one of the artist s lead rolls has been used to move the oil and charcoal across the sheet of paper Critic David Pagel has further expounded upon the significance of Serra s drawing practice and its relationship to his sculpture Richard Serra s drawings are two dimensional equivalents of his daunting steel sculptures Extremely weighty grave authoritative and deliberate they formally address physical issues of gravity and mass presence and absence Unlike his sculptures however Serra s drawings are comfortably scaled to the size of an individual human body If not quite intimate they are still gorgeously seductive inviting the close up face to face scrutiny and inch by inch exploration we normally associate with easel paintings portraits and still lifes E mphasizing the sensuous exquisite and delicate nature of his drawings captures the fugitive beauty of their dense thickly built up blacks on creamy or icy white paper 2Related works on paper are housed in the collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York The Museum of Modern Art New York the Whitney Museum of American Art New York and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art San Francisco 1 Richard Serra A Drawing in Five Parts 2005 The Metropolitan Museum of Art https www metmuseum org art collection search 4981842 David Pagel Art Reviews Sensuous and Seductive Minimalist Drawings in Los Angeles Times November 6 1993 https www latimes com archives la xpm 1993 11 06 ca 53706 story html

Manish Nai has created a small   Photography on Pigment Print on Hahnemuhle Paper in the modern year of 2021.0 As Manish Nai and the photographer Anil Rane scoured the expressway linking Bombay and Pune for vacant billboards a new series was born in his mind In periods when no commercial use was being made of billboards in the early 2010 they often advertised contact details of the firm that rented them out The phone numbers would usually be painted by hand in huge lettering When the space was leased the panels would be taken down only to be reused later as supports Since they were not visible in their role as backing material the panels would be placed in random order scrambling the numbers and letters painted on them Finally when the new advertisements came down the scrambled panels would be Revealed When photographed without reference to their context these billboards appear like ciphers enigmatic bits of code incomplete messages composed in that archetypal form of modernist abstraction the grid Rosalind Krauss in her seminal essay on the grid refers to it as a paradigm or model for the antidevelopmental the antinarrative the antihistorical Manish s grids in contrast open out to narrative and history Those unaware of their context sense the existence of a story behind the images while those who know the story find new puzzles in the decontextualized images They are to reiterate photographs of paintings that have in the course of removal from their utilitarian function as conveyors of a message been accidentally reconfigured to resemble paintings from a tradition with no utilitarian function modernist abstraction and been introduced into that second tradition by the artist who recognised the happy accident His photographs paradoxically acquire a place within the history of painterly abstraction that paintings would have been hard pressed to gain He achieves this just as he does with sculptures and works in jute on canvas through a profound receptivity to his physical surroundings and a process of sublimating and elevating humble source materials and mediums Excerpt from Manish Nai Capturing Time by Girish Shahane 2018 Published by the Het Noordbrabants Museum

Magdalena Jitrik has created a small cheap Painting on oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Goticas or Little drops is a classical example of Magdalena Jitrik use of language and abstraction to propose new landscapes of thought It is a reflexion on the dismissal of possible alternatives to the COVID vaccine produced by developing countries like Venezuela or Cuba that are not taken into account by the global entities due to the political discourse of its leaders even when their researchers and Health Institutes are well regard by the scientific community It also brings to mind the generosity of Albert Sabin the creator of the polio vaccine that was administered as drops and who for the greater good of eliminating a crippling illness chose not no patent his discovery in order to make available to everyone 
Magdalena Jitrik has created a small cheap Painting on oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 This is one of the most introspective works of the series Having encounter difficulties with the so far believed task of the artist as registrar of the events of their time Jitrik creates an abstract landscape with the surreal presence of several floating eyes that look and are looked at The feeling that the only contribution of value is to stay at home protecting one self and at the same time the others becomes overwhelming with a profound discomfort when observing the consequences of the global pandemic and the alienating sensation of helplessness that came along with it

Dena Yago has created a medium nominal Painting on Acrylic and inkjet on canvas in aluminum and stainless steel frame in the modern year of 2021.0 In this painted screen a group of puppies from the 1961 Disney film 101 Dalmatians is gathered on what appears as an urban street corner with power lines and street signs overhead The image is divided by the panels of the painted screen creating a visual composition similar to the page of a comic book Through a text box an unseen speaker informs the Dalmatians that the franchise is dead eliminating the possibility of the resurrection of these characters through another reboot or adaptation One puppy receives this news with relief sinking into sleep while another looks alarmed realizing that her existence depends on the whims of future audiences Bodega s presentation of Dena Yago at Art Basel 2021 consists primarily of three painted dressing screens which divide and move viewers through the space Similar to Yago s wall paintings each dressing screen is an allegorical exploration of emergent issues in contemporary culture something akin to a visual essay Because of their human scale these painted screens require a different kind of attention than the handheld ones to which we are generally so accustomed emphasizing the viewer s physical experience of reading On the reverse of each screen panels dominated by color fields offer contemplative moments of transition between these image texts Building on her work as both an artist and a trend forecaster these painted screens integrate elements of Yago s visual practice with her writing creating new formal possibilities for reflection and cultural critique 
Luke Fowler has created a small nominal Photography on Series of C-Type colour print in the modern year of 2021.0 His previous works have been described as para documentary interweaving archival footage and material with his own camerawork archive and sounds However in these more personal works the striking quality of sensitivity and openness which refuses to shy away from the complexities of lived experience and familial history lingers long after viewing encouraging one to ruminate on their own inherited legacies

Andy Meerow has created a small cheap Painting on Enamel on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 The paintings in this series arrive via a sequence of interruptions Rather than working these canvases fluidly from start to finish Meerow mimics the mechanized qualities of an over printed image which has been run through the machine a second third or fourth time pressurizing the imagery within the flatness of its layered plane Redacted texts and obscured graphics convey a vague sense of conflict perhaps between the legible messaging germane to commercial sign painting techniques and an opposing drive within the artist toward abstract speech This tension between tightly organized information and its lack of literal coherence might be seen as an analogue for the vulnerability of order in our world

Rina Mizuno has created a medium cheap Painting on oil, ballpoint pen  on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0  In my works there are three elements that I treasure Decorativeness of Middle Eastern miniature paintings the brush strokes in traditional Japanese ink paintings such as Jakuchu Ito and the raw canvas fabric It is my intent to bring out the potentials from each of these elements while combining them together to make a layered composition over the pictorial space Surrealistic optical illusion which is originally unique to painting is also one of my interests I always expect that the artwork that can even amaze its own artist will be able to greatly effect the mass audience beyond a normal thrill Therefore I always try to create a painting that you could See a part in a glance but impossible to see it whole MIZUNO Rina

Johannes Kahrs has created a medium nominal Painting on Oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 The sinister yet familiar hyperrealism of Kahrs painting provokes entangled empathy and reveals the hidden side of human presence The subject of the German author s artwork presents himselves in all his human indecipherability shaken by pressures and thoughts Kahrs painting is distinguished by its intense emotional power and its perceptual and psychological impact The starting point of each of his works are either photographs or cinema or television stills or as has been the case for his most recent works photos taken by the artist himself

Eva Schlegel has created a large nominal Sculpture on acrylic glass mirror, steel cable in the modern year of 2021.0 Eva Schlegel was born 1960 in Tyrol Austria She studied art from 1979 until 1985 at the Angewandte University in Vienna Austria Her work includes photography objects but also installation works which are implemented experimentally and spatially by using different media such as photography on lead mirror or glass She questions the limits of perception of common viewing habits Since 1995 Eva Schlegel has completed numerous public art projects in Austria and abroad Schlegel s work has been collected by over 40 major institutions around the world The sculpture Untitled 2019 2021 consists of 8 assembled mirror elements forming a freely turning non symmetric sculpture which is reflecting and re reflecting the surrounding space A reflected image is fascinating because it is a fleeting image A reflected image depends on the presence spatially and temporally of what is being reflected A mirror has many varied and contradictory metaphorical meanings In behavioural science recognising one s own reflection is regarded as a sign of intelligence and the capacity for abstract thought Culturally and historically the mirror symbolises alongside vanity self awareness wisdom and truth In ancient cultures a mirror stood for the image of the soul Celtic women were buried with their mirrors In ancient Egypt the words for mirror and for life were identical Sabine Fellner mentiones in her text on Eva Schlegel The sculpture shown here is a logical extension of Schlegels explorations of space In 2005 she extended space by opening up the floor of the Secession with huge mirrors on the ground In 2016 she constructed a walk in labyrinth of steel elements and mirrors that suspended the laws of space opening up the view into infinite spaces and skilfully mobilising the potential for associations as the viewer explicitly did not reflect him herself in the huge mirror sculptures Cloud Space 2019 is a walk in pavilion entirely built of circular mirrors and in 2020 she realized the three Keplers laws by means of a three dimensional mirror installation A new body of work part of the artist s continuing series of blurred spaces asks the viewer to reconsider the role that architecture plays in society and in one s psyche A continuation of the artist s larger than life blurred women series this body of work forces the viewer to confront architecture as a set of constraints that program human activity The works reposition hallways walls corners beams and portals through an abstract lens in order to interrogate how the establishment of architectural space is designed to affect and govern physical actions and thereby to influence the construction of one s persona Similar to how blurred women asks us to consider the stability and construction of one s identity blurred spaces asks the viewer to think about the effects of subverting the solidity and rationality of architectural space 
Jannis Varelas has created a large nominal Painting on oil, pastel and gesso on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Jannis Varelas was born 1977 in Athens Greece lives and works in Athens and Los Angeles USA The Greek artist Jannis Varelas unveils the surprising side of banal elements in everyday life Playfully fusing abstraction and realistic representation his paintings explore lived spaces through a myriad of collage like details He constructs the reality from fragments like in archeological excavations lived moments are presented to us in a seemingly arbitrary composition of random traces We are shown a lighter lying on a packet of cigarettes a small stained cloth resembling the head of a mythical creature food leftovers shaped like a happy face when seen from a specific perspective these insignificant remnants suggest a different reality that can open up to a new dimension full of possibilities The signs and symbols in Varelas work resemble automatic painting or children s drawings with added dynamism deriving from the artist s highly physical expressive technique His work reflects on social issues and the plight of humanity in world history but the thematic content is expressed in a web of subtle allusions that spontaneously follow the artist s irrational trains of thought Varelas work has been exhibited widely around the world at venues such as the Palais de Tokyo in Paris London s Saatchi Gallery Benaki Museum Athens and the Kunsthalle Wien The artist divides his time between Los Angeles Vienna and Athens This work is part of a new series of paintings as the outcome of a process of performances and metamorphoses of the self With these works Varelas goes back to the images of the body exploring the gendered cultural representations of the human figure The artist chooses his models among his friends and neighbours and has them dressed specifically to be photographed in the specially laid out setting of his studio together with everyday objects from the Historical Collections of the Benaki Museum as well as seemingly unimportant or trivial objects from the fleeting wanderings of urban or domestic life The photographic rendering of the event provides the semantic raw material it is then transferred onto the canvas and transformed and diffracted by the language of painting

Christopher Wool has created a medium expensive Painting on Alkyd and Flashe on Aluminium in the classic year of 1987.0 In Christopher Wool s hands the ubiquitous paint roller is transformed into a bold new technique loaded with art historical references The use of an all over pattern demonstrates the artist s absorption in the influence of Abstract Expressionism in particular the work of Jackson Pollock while the painting s status as hand made object reveals a fascination with Marcel Duchamp s readymade The totality of design consumes the viewer creating a captivating surface over which the eye dances unable to rest on any single place thanks to the painting s deceptive uniformity

 has created a large cheap Painting on acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 The initial idea of this work came from a simple observation of the body how we are often unconscious of the movements of our bodies It is said that in 24 hours we are only fully aware of the condition of our bodies 5 of the time Beyond that our bodies are on autopilot and we often forget that they perform an extraordinary range of motion Thumbs scrolling sitting down tying shoes feeling the cold sensation of the floor on the soles of our feet wiping sweat from the forehead movements that seem simple are often taken for granted and escape our gratitude But this is not the case for those who have difficulty moving because of the pain in their bodies indieguerillas imagine that all the characters in the painting are in motion waving and flowing consciously along with the rhythm of the universe like dancing a dance of the soul Through the work indieguerillas are inviting us to be grateful for the health of our bodies that allows us to move freely and to love ourselves

Theaster Gates has created a medium expensive Other Materials on Wooden vitrine, glass and various objects in the modern year of 2019.0 The work of Theaster Gates is deeply engaged in material and cultural production preservation and presentation especially as they relate to historical and contemporary power dynamics The present work Malaga Vitrine 1 makes these concerns explicit by placing otherwise unrelated objects of ambiguous origin together in a wall mounted vitrine With this arrangement of found and studio made objects placed behind glass Gates assembles a loose narrative intended to provoke questions of cultural representation and knowledge production particularly within museological displays Malaga Vitrine 1 was an integral work in Gates s 2019 2020 exhibition Amalgam which debuted at the Palais de Tokyo and later traveled to TATE Liverpool This exhibition explored the social histories of migration and interracial relations during a specific episode in American history the little known story of Malaga Island off the coast of Maine The island was home to a small community of Black white and mixed race people from the end of the Civil War until 1912 when they were evicted from their homes by the state s governor The exhibition s title Amalgam a near anagram to Malaga has also been used in the past to denote racial ethnic and religious mingling For Gates the term has acquired an even more charged significance impelling his practice toward new formal and conceptual explorations in film sculpture architecture and music The objects in Malaga Vitrine 1 reference the cultural hybridity on Malaga Island though there is no direct link to its history Presented with deliberate ambiguity Gates not only prompts viewers of his vitrines to question historical narratives and museological framing devices but also leaves room for his viewers to read other histories into the installations of assorted objects Gates similarly invites us to question our very ability as historically removed onlookers to digest Malaga s history via artifactual objects

Jo Baer has created a small cheap Work on Paper on Inkjet print with colored pencil on papare in the classic year of 2002.0  Jo Baer 1929 in Seattle USA lives and works in Amsterdam NetherlandsJo Baer was a key figure among the celebrated protagonists of Minimalist painting in New York in the 1960s and first half of the 70 s What has long been regarded as a radical transition from the earlier minimalist painting to the fluid and dreamlike pictorial mode that she famously came to term radical figuration is recently being now perceived as a continuum rather than a paradigm shift In the last decades Jo Baer has dramatically expanded the conceptual framework of her earliest minimalist paintings not so much replacing one ism with another as reconciling and binding together her myriad and divergent concerns ranging from the science of color perception to the workings of myth and collective memory The starting point for all paintings in Jo Baer s oeuvre was always drawing and collage Later in the nineties collages were made digitally then printed out and drawn upon The drawings of Jo Baer reveal in the most direct and intimate way the thought and creative processes of her practice of what she had entitled herself Radical Figuration The recent international recognition of the post minimalist oeuvre is closely linked to a new reading of the live time achievements The retrospective at Ludwig Museum in 2011 followed the curatorial thesis that there always has been an underlying continuation in Baer s oeuvre which can be traced by studying her drawing practice Since then Baer s oeuvre used to be viewed as having a radical break after her minimalist period Since then the Radical Figuration paintings have entered high profile museum collections such as the MOMA and the Whitney Museum

Kinga Bartis has created a medium cheap Painting on Charcoal and pencil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Kinga Bartis approach to painting lies outside the boundaries of the classic school of painting Eschewing labels Bartis envisions painting as a means of breaking free from the habitual relationship of defining and redefining of our existence looking towards a more multidisciplinary and open approach Repeating imagery of bodies figures nature and landscapes combine to reflect the realties of a shifting world Often blending one into the other the resulting ambiguity provides a backdrop for elements to ebb and flow almost moving subtly on the canvas revealing themselves organically Reoccurring themes of sexuality power structures the body and self perception can be felt through these motions as they pulsate towards us Their presence does not suggest a direction that Bartis wishes us to go in but rather a mood or a feeling a platform through which discussions are encouraged

Trisha Baga has created a small expensive Installation on canvas, oil, video file; Installation dimensions variable in the modern year of 2021.0 The American artist Trisha Baga has built a reputation for work that gleans the margins of the digital and the logic of online browsing to create dreamy layered narratives in physical space A large scale painting provides the score for Baga s new installation which weaves together contrasting events aspects and moods of the present moment into a constellation of light projections staged objects and sculpture She adopts an emphatically multi disciplinary approach in her beguiling installation intertwining the ordinary and the remarkable to blur the thin line between our online and offline lives The presentation is ultimately a science fiction a mutating ecosystem in which the visitor participates with their attention and presence Trisha Baga born 1985 in Venice Florida creates immersive multi media installations Compelled by an interest in what she calls the stuff that fills the gaps she recombines objects and images into scenarios that address issues related to the environment technology and identity Baga lives and works in New York

Olafur Eliasson has created a large expensive Sculpture on Coloured glass (yellow, purple, blue), silver, driftwood in the modern year of 2021.0 These two dimensional sculptural piece consists of colored glass panes from which elliptical shapes have been removed Supported by a piece of horizontally installed driftwood the glass panes lean upon each other as their ellipses overlap creating a variety of color saturation shades and tones The necessary imperfection of the finite balance is an extension of Olafur s interest in the pigments and visual effects created by the superimposition of colored transparent layers The visitor oscillates between viewing the piece head on gaining the complete color spectrum of the combined panes and from the side discovering the depth and construction of the layers In this oscillation the focus fades from the colors to the objects that produce them and back to the colors again Olafur Eliasson s Artist Page 
Brook Hsu has created a small cheap Painting on Oil on wood in the modern year of 2021.0 On Tree in a Landscape series It s hard to describe what these paintings really are I think of them in the same ways as the larger works but they carry a kind of sentimentality that the ink paintings cannot really capture The tree originated in an older work that I made titled Snake and Tree in a Landscape I like to think of all the parts in these works as interlocking discrete entities the tree the woods the grass the hills distance and weather etc To that effect the works could be about composition and abstraction but they still carry with them the mythology and symbolism of the forms although here there is an attempt to understand the forms without any meaning aside from the things themselves tree is tree woods is woods grass is grass hills are hills distance is distance weather is weather etc Brook Hsu
Mirko Baselgia has created a medium cheap Sculpture on newsprint paper on CNS panel in the modern year of 2021.0 Tartaruga Global Times is part of the series Tartarugas reliefs that represent a recurring animal in Mirko Baselgia s 1982 Switzerland works because of its strong connection with the earth and also as a symbol of the time of origins wisdom and immortality The artist fascinated by the visible manifestations of the passage of time such as the annual rings of tree trunks or the shape of shells is also interested in the shell of turtles as a material expression of their biography In fact the scales that cover the shell have a series of concentric stripes each corresponding to approximately one year of the animal s life The layers of newsprint glued by hand on top of each other create this turtle shell and bring to mind the layered structure of rocks showing the chronology of different historical periods The decision to use old newspapers whose names are directly related to the concept of time Global Times The New York Times Die Zeit is not only linked to the idea of a narrative that is built up and rebuilt day by day but also aims to highlight the most topical issue of press freedom and the quality of the daily press In the constant flow of more or less truthful and incoming news in which we live the slowness and persistence characteristic of turtles remind us that quality often takes time 
Atelier Van Lieshout has created a large nominal Sculpture on mannequin, steel, wood in the modern year of 2021.0 ATELIER VAN LIESHOUTAtelier Van Lieshout is the studio founded by sculptor and visionary Joep van Lieshout After graduating at the Rotterdam Art Academy Van Lieshout quickly rose to fame with projects that travelled between the world of easy clean design and the non functional area of art sculpture and installations buildings and furniture utopias and dystopias In 1995 Van Lieshout founded his studio and has been working solely under the studio s name ever since The studio moniker exists in Van Lieshout s practice as a methodology toward undermining the myth of the artistic genius Over the past three decades Van Lieshout has established a multidisciplinary practice that produces works on the borders between art design and architecture By investigating the thin line between manufacturing art and mass producing functional objects he seeks to find the boundaries between fantasy and function between fertility and destruction Van Lieshout dissects systems be it society as a whole or the human body he experiments looks for alternatives takes exhibitions as experiments for recycling and has even declared an independent state in the port of Rotterdam AVL Ville 2001 a free state in the Rotterdam harbour with a minimum of rules a maximum of liberties and the highest degree of autarky All of these activities are conducted within Van Lieshout s signature style of provocation be it political or material Van Lieshout combines an imaginative aesthetic and ethic with a spirit of entrepreneurship his work has motivated movements in the fields of architecture and ecology and has been internationally celebrated exhibited and published His works share a number of recurring themes motives and obsessions systems power autarky life sex and death each of these trace the human individual in the face of a greater whole such as his well known work the Domestikator 2015 This sculpture caused controversy before even being placed at the Louvre in Jardin de Tuilleries but was adopted by Centre Pompidou where it was shown during FiAC 2017 The work Bas is part of the series Sacrifice 2021 by Atelier Van Lieshout To most westerners war is a historic phenomenon Most World War II veterans have passed away and their experiences during the last armed conflict on Dutch soil have become lore Most of the time war is spoken of figuratively battles against drug addiction cultural wars conducted on social media and even the fight against Covid 19 has been framed in military terms But these conflicts lack the physical immediacy of an actual war In his classic novel The Darkroom of Damocles Dutch author W F Hermans argued that individuals only show their true nature while under extreme duress war being the ultimate crisis That s when they show their best qualities and their worst Unheard of cruelty and betrayal as well as limitless self sacrifice and friendship War may lead to genocide but can also spawn social and technological progress That certainly holds true for World War I a strong point of reference for Atelier Van Lieshout s installation Sacrifice The Great War sped up the acceptance of women s suffrage and the development of aviation However this came at the cost of 17 million lives most of which were lost in the trenches of the Somme on the Gallipoli peninsula or in the Belgian heartland Sacrifice shows the reduction of individuals to cannon fodder human bodies turning into organic waste In this chaotic abundance heavily armed soldiers and nurses stand side by side with clowns and gods Body parts are severed and sometimes reconnected but not always correctly Sacrifice pairs gritty realism with absurdity and freewheeling creativity Sacrifice is the result of a period of unfiltered productivity A universe of human strengths and failings was created inspired by the hundreds of sketches Joep van Lieshout makes weekly Mannequins costumes and other objets trouv s were often used enabling high speed and an intuitive expressive looseness more akin to painting than sculpture High art motifs have been combined with base nastiness and even anti art sculptures wilfully turned into lamps or candlesticks This installation is the precursor to AVL s The Maze a sculptural playground containing AVL works from every period that will be constructed at AVL s soon to be built storage facility Sacrifice also invites visitors to wander among the sculptures and become part of this carnival of death But the negativity also summons up contrary emotions deep love religious enlightenment and the feeling of truly being alive This is typical for the ambiguity that runs through all AVL s work Sacrifice downplays our overinflated sense of personal importance Keyboard warriors fight anonymously or make demands without conflict or opposition Pampered by helicopter parents and overregulating authorities people are barely capable of making sacrifices anymore Sacrifice is not about the glorification of war but it does stress the fact that true change usually comes with violence and victims No evolution without destruction It s what makes us human and extremely dangerous Selection of Exhibitions Pioneer Works New York City 2019 Design Museum London 2018 NDSM Wharf Amsterdam 2018 Alte National Galerie

Waqas Khan has created a large nominal Work on Paper on ink on paper in the modern year of 2021.0 WAQAS KHAN born in Akhtarabad Pakistan in 1982 lives and works in Lahore Khan is influenced by the delicate Bardhakhat procedure based on the traditional Persian Mughal miniature painting Transforming the traditional practice of miniature painting into a contemporary context Khan applies millions of tiny dots lines and stripes meticulously to the paper with a dowel usually used by architects for technical drafting In my work I challenge miniature painting and at the same time leave it open for discussion The result appears as a fusion of different media from the distance one experiences the artwork being a print going closer seeing that the fine structure not beeing printed but made by hand The focus of Khans art lays on the emotional and spiritual connection to the observer I want the viewer to actually look at the works and through my work I want to evoke a dialogue between the viewer and the work It s all about assimilating from outside to inside and letting the outside image enter inside you The final product is akin to a visual narration which should be read and explored by the spectator To approach the oeuvre of Waqas Khan is to discover an existential statement that is at once decisive and delicate to sense a truth that is deep convincing and subtle In his drawings we perceive the strength of a will that hopes to leave a mark on the existential space we all share and that opens us up to the awareness of the passing of time These compositions have been defined as minimalist and yet they do not match the rigid aesthetic of the industrial serialisation that lies at the origin of the name In Waqas Khan s visual narratives syntax is based on repetitions and series of similar though unique signs connected by pauses breaks and rhythms that are absolutely organic These precise signs appear as his studio is gradually permeated by solitude and the silence of night This is when the artist as a medium contributes to the flow of the lan vital that springs from his thoughts and emotions His individual rhythms end up configuring maps in which the viewer will play an active role striking up a dialogue between equals in a game of mirror reflections In 2018 he was awarded the NDTV Spectrum award in transformation in visual arts in Southeast Asia and the ACTA awarded in arts in 2013 he was nominated for the Jameel Prize EXHIBITIONS Lahore Biennale 01 Lahore Pakistan 2018 GA Waqas Khan Manchester Art Gallery Manchester GB 2017 EA 57th Venice Biennale Viva Arte Viva Venice Italy 2017 GA Doublethink Double vision curated by Alistair Hicks Pera Museum Istanbul Turkey 2017 GA The Absence of Path 57th Venice Biennale Venice Italy 2017 GA Decor curated by Tino Sehgal Villa Empain Fondation Boghossian Brussels Belgium 2016 GA Between Structure and Matter Other Minimal Futures curated by Prajit Dutta and Murtaza Vali Aicon Gallery New York USA 2016 GA Dhaka Art Summit 2016 Dhaka Bangladesh GA Fear nothing she says When art reveals mystic truths curated by Rosa Martinez Museu Nacional de Escultura Valladolid Spain 2015 GA Jameel Prize 3 NTU Singapore Singapore Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization Sharjah 2015 GA and Hermitage Kazan Museum Menge Museum Moscow Moscow 2014 GA Drawingroom curated by Peter Weiermair Galerie im Taxispalais Innsbruck Austria 2014 and in the Ursula Blickle Foundation Vienna 2013 GA Victoria Albert Museum London 2013 GA PUBLIC COLLECTIONS British Museum London UK Victoria and Albert Museum London UK Kiran Nadar Museum New Delhi India Devi Art Foundation New Delhi India Deutsche Bank Frankfurt Germany Manchester Art Gallery Manchester UK Whitworth Art Gallery Manchester UK Manchester Museum Manchester UK

Meret Oppenheim has created a small expensive Painting on oil crayon on cardboard in the classic year of 1973.0 born 1913 in Berlin Charlottenburg she died 1985 Oppenheim s drawings a crucial means of expression for her can be traced from her early pencil drawings and watercolours in her youth to the later magnificent gouaches dating from 1985 the year she died One central period was the 1930s a time in which the ready availability of the inexpensive medium played an important role enabling the artist to use the ink drawing to jot down her ideas After the war and in the 1960s and 1970s in particular she created more crayon and pastel drawings Meret Oppenheim s works in which the artist employs a reduced often sparse pictorial repertory confirm that immediacy is more crucial for the quality of a drawing than virtuosity Such qualities of the drawing were certainly highly congenial with the artist s artistic approach with its characteristic openness directness and intuition Nature i e transformational vital processes the elementary forces and polarities also of the sexes as well as the temporal and cosmic integration are central themes of the artist s work What prevails are an abstract linear drawing style in which the figures and things are captured in a few reduced contours What is represented is seldom narrative and its theme can hardly be clearly identified Even the titles can be a bit enigmatic Grotesque and even poetical titles can evoke associations or be provocative given their seeming arbitrariness Many drawings show an affinity to the works of surrealist artists In keeping with Breton s literary technique the so called criture automatique they try to tap the possibilities of psychic automatism in the work with images Even Meret Oppenheim was able to discover unknown pictorial forms in which unconscious contents can emerge in experiences taking place in the liminal realm between a waken and a dream state or in the process of drawing

Daniel Richter has created a large expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 The German artist Daniel Richter s latest series of vibrant large scale oil paintings is the next experimental step in a visual language that has evolved across his career In bedroht und schuldig 2021 transient shifting figures that seem to unite elements of human ape and machine flicker in and out of view applied with a palette knife then outlined with graphic strokes of oil crayon As Richter explains My concern is with the surface this flat tangled never changing scheme of figure constellations in and out The title of the work which translates as threatened and guilty as well as Richter s bold use of contrasting colour predominated by yellows reds and greens indicate this episodic interpersonal friction but to Richter it s more a question of systems of representation rather than portraying the body as a carnal biological thing 
Georg Baselitz has created a large expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Georg Baselitz s practice is in constant evolution drawing upon both art history and his own extensive oeuvre Sonnabend 2021 is an example of a recent important development in the artist s style a paint transfer technique marked by lightness boldness and vivid colouration conceived as an homage to Roy Lichtenstein The process of transferring paint from one canvas to another also recalls Andy Warhol s blotted line technique from the 1950s through which he combined ink drawing with basic printmaking in order to make a variety of illustrations on a similar theme Sonnabend is a German word for Saturday along with the more common Samstag Loosely translated Sonnabend means the eve of Sunday a title which suggests the intimacy of Baselitz painting his own wife Elke whose image has occupied a prominent position in his practice for over 50 years This work shows Elke enthroned on a stage like construction against an unusually neutral background Her figure stands out pastose and multipartite evoking existentialist connotations through her solitary suspension in the undefined space 
Robert Longo has created a medium expensive Work on Paper on Charcoal on mounted paper in the modern year of 2020.0 Robert Longo is best known for his large scale hyper realistic charcoal drawings whose narrative strength and emotive impact come from the transformation of the intimate practice of drawing into the monumental scale of painting as well as the meticulous detail he achieves in charcoal In Untitled White Peonies 2020 Longo invites the viewer to reflect on the shades and movements of an element normally considered purely white Although limiting his medium to the extreme contrasts of black and white using charcoal as his only tool Longo s technique nevertheless draws out the full imaginative range in this forceful and unstable medium Flowers have long featured in Longo s work in particular the blooming red rose from his Ophelia series 
Robert Rauschenberg has created a large expensive Painting on Oil and silkscreen ink on canvas in the classic year of 1963.0 We are delighted to present works by Robert Rauschenberg at Art Basel on our Booth B3 Hall 2 0 and as part of Unlimited Robert Rauschenberg s Star Grass 1963 is a prime example of an early silkscreen painting It was acquired in 1964 by Washington based collectors Margot and Gilbert Hahn from Leo Castelli Gallery in New York and remained in their collection for over fifty years Star Grass sets the bright lights of the New York skyline against an image of the Ring Nebula in the northern constellation of Lyra superimposed on a striped fabric whose lines add dynamism to the composition The title and combination of images references Vincent van Gogh s Starry Night 1889 pictured with the French village replaced by the lights and bustle of New York City and the nebula standing in for the night sky These cityscape and nebula images were also paired in other Rauschenberg paintings from the same year Die Hard 1963 and Stop Gap 1963 pictured However Star Grass is unique among the artist s silkscreen paintings in that it is far from crowded creating an interplay between the images and negative space Rather than silkscreening the image uniformly Rauschenberg revealed his process by displacing the edges of the overlapping imprints so that the orb of the moon appears in triplicate His addition of a contrasting red square at the bottom of the work is a particularly poetic inflection which recalls his red brushwork in Stop Gap The painting was shown in the 28th Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting at the Corcoran Gallery Washington D C in 1963 and it features in the catalogue for an important survey of Rauschenberg s silkscreen paintings at the Whitney Museum New York in 1990 
Tony Cragg has created a large expensive Sculpture on Stainless steel in the classic year of 2018.0 The renowned British sculptor Tony Cragg draws on both nature and industrial systems in creating his unique sculptural language While his early sculptures were accumulations of found objects Cragg s recent works are created in more traditional sculptural materials such as wood bronze and steel Cragg s Stages 2018 recalls natural geological forms such as the weathering of rock by the forces of wind and water but cast in gleaming stainless steel The upright form attains a totemic quality yet any sense of permanence is undermined by its highly polished surface which reflects the ephemerality of its surroundings including light and movement The delicacy of the undulating form suggests a rivulet of water as if frozen in motion but also hints at human profiles that seem to emerge and disappear in its curves

Hans Schabus has created a large cheap Sculpture on concrete, iron oxid, brass polished, lacquer in the modern year of 2020.0 born 1970 in Watschnig Austria lives and works in Vienna I also think that places of art have become showcases shop windows and tableaus These places are also containers for history stories In this sense the secrets of these places interest me Of course a place also always refers to an outside another place this one from which I m just coming or one to which I would then go And thus a kind of in between space emerges I can also imagine and take this in between space everywhere else And thus a certain place becomes charged again in a different way In this way I can generate a different content and interpret the place which also always has to do with a new expression of one s own scope Hans Schabus 
Martin Walde has created a large nominal Sculpture on wire and silicone in the classic year of 2017.0 Martin Walde 1957 in Innsbruck Austria lives and works in Vienna Austria belongs to a different generation of artists than Beuys Smithson or the representatives of Arte Povera Although many of the materials used by Walde can be linked to Beuys s plastic theory they relate to a different context Most of the materials are more non specific coded as those from the arte povera era if only because silicone carbon polystyrene or gel are groups of substances whose production and specific properties are often unknown to the majority of people So Waldes works are always about creation myths and fantasies of origin in whose evocation the materiality and the physical state of the substances play a major role In particular gels i e macromolecular between the familiar aggregate states are predestined for this since they have a tradition that is also relevant to literature Hallucigenia The paleontologist S Conway Morris assessed in 1977 an animal from the most creative phase of evolution and gives it the immortal name Hallucigenia Precambrian about 600 720 million years ago This animal which can be described as a being rather than a detectable species is extremely fragmentary and fragile in its provable existence Therefore it takes a lot of imagination to imagine the scenario of its environment at the time and when imagination replaces provable facts the possibilities of errors are boundless Barely published the scientist s Hallucigenia Science 1977 slips out of control of his discovery Motivated by the irrational urge to replace the unknown with the familiar Hallucigenia has become a popular screen for scientists and lay people in the public controversy Ultimately all represent the same animal Hallucigenia is therefore a being with multiple manifestations leaving aside the chronology of the different perceptions that define only the current state closest to the truth When I became aware of the drawing of S Conway Morris in the mid 80s there was nothing more than this sketch a few guesses and the name Hallucigenia This was the opportunity to distort the role of art and as an artist take a perspective whose developments and consequences were unforeseeable In retrospect it is not least a mutual game between science and art in which the search for certainty is a possible common perspective 
Alex Katz has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 In the early 1950s the New York painter Alex Katz developed his own distinctive style poised between formalism and representation and in reaction to Abstract Expressionism Primarily working from life he makes paintings in which line and form are expressed through carefully composed strokes and planes of flat colour In Vivien with Black Cap 1 Smile 2021 Katz explores the subtleties of human facial expressions as indicated by a faraway gaze the tilt of a head or the creases created by a smile This is intensified through the close cropping and cinematic lighting of the portrait in which the woman s face nearly fills the pictorial space framed by her black hair which contrasts with the pale green background The artist s minimal aesthetic and the pristine flatness of his painted surfaces anticipated Pop Art in many ways although Katz defines his work independently of any particular movement 
Donald Judd has created a large expensive Sculpture on Douglas fir plywood in the classic year of 1977.0 One of the most influential artists of the post war period Judd radically transformed our notions of the visible by opting for a rigorous visual vocabulary which emphasizes simple proportions and the openness of form Judd s first three dimensional works had been constructed in wood and he favoured this material for its rigidity and high stability that allowed for great precision The grain of the wood becomes an integral part of the surface in line with Judd s belief that artworks should preclude illusion After exploring the use of metal from the mid 1960s onwards he returned to plywood as a material in the 1970s The plywood wall mounted box from 1977 belongs to a group of works referred to as meter boxes as they very specifically measure 100 x 50 x 50 cm The box incorporates a diagonal panel which conveys a sense of movement and depth in the work The diagonal emerged from Judd s work with plywood and would become entrenched into his formal language later appearing in his work with other materials

Alighiero Boetti has created a small expensive Work on Paper on Ballpoint pen on card;11 parts, 70 × 100 cm each in the classic year of 1973.0 This monumental work by the conceptual artist Alighiero Boetti is from his eponymous Ononimo series it is the largest of the Biro ballpoint pen works along with I sei sensi There are five works of this scale in the series another of which is housed at the Municipal Museum of Art in Toyota Japan Ononimo 1973 consists of 11 panels of minutely hatched marks of ballpoint pen with the title left exposed in white at the top The title is a play on the Italian words anonimo anonymous and omonimo homonymous words having the same spelling or pronunciation but different meanings It references Boetti s radical notion that the authorship of a work of art is not dependent on physical production Indeed much of Boetti s work was delegated to anonymous artisans Their roles in executing Boetti s ideas from his mosaic like word grids geopolitical maps and various tapestries to his Biro works are what give essence to his output Ononimo is a superb example of this groundbreaking dialogue Alighiero Boetti born 1940 in Turin died 1994 in Rome manipulated a photograph in 1968 to create an image of himself holding hands with his twin In the early 1970s he began to insert an e between his first and last names to become Alighiero e Boetti to dilute attachments to authorship and address the omnipresence of dualities

Mira Schor has created a small nominal Painting on Oil on 7 linen canvases in the classic year of 1994.0 The period before and around War Frieze in the late 80s and early 90s was a particularly productive one for Schor painting There are relationships between many of the groups of works produced in that time period in terms of format image content painterly qualities palette and language The three works titled Margin of Safety were made concurrently with War Frieze and were named and numbered in order as a part of it They are visually composed like the rest of War Frieze with appropriated language flowing between gendered body fragments over several conjoined canvases The language represented in all three margin of safety paintings is consistent with other phrases used during this period that are appropriated from terminology referring to women s bodies abortion regulations and breast cancer surgery all of which can be repurposed to describe war

Julie Lænkholm has created a medium nominal Mixed Media on Natural dyed wool on silk in the modern year of 2021.0 Julie L nkholm s practice has its roots in the ideas and the methods centred around collective learning Exploring techniques and practices which have been traditionally been passed down orally from generation to generation L nkholm activates a predominantly female driven history which has been forgotten or otherwise actively ignored Using materials such as wool silk and denim L nkholm treats them with natural plant based dyes using historic methods The specificity and the technical backdrop of this process comes through to create a very tactile three dimensional feeling that emanates from the work unlocking a kind of atmospheric presence that can be readily sensed The works feel as if they are in continual evolution as if they remain alive long after they seem to be finished We become participants of the work activating the work while the work simultaneously activates us There is a generosity inherent in L nkholm practice Works are presented in a way that imparts its process onwards and in so doing imparts the knowledge that is transmitted with it The connections and interaction with the works adds to this consciousness as we find ourselves becoming integrated into this collective learning process

Georges Braque has created a small expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1942.0 In La Sauci re Georges Braque revisits his early fascination with Cubist conceptions surrounding space A highly texturised and inventive still life the present work exemplifies the artist s engagement with the theme of the pedestal table a leitmotif that occupied his uvre from 1911 to 1952 Painted in 1942 amidst the drama of the Second World War the present work liberates the purely relational space between mundane objects by juxtaposing them against the surface of a dark table top and muted background in the process Braque emphasises his naturalistic view point which at the time of the war had transformed into a more intimate and ritualistic iconography In contrast to Braque s early Cubist still lifes the present work demonstrates the austerities of life in occupied Paris the cherries lemons glass sauce boat potato and fork are sparsely scattered across the table top illustrating wartime scarcity Although Braque famously disclaimed all symbolic interpretations of his work the spatial concerns of his still life are still at the mercy of circumstance and La Sauci re contemplatively praises man s ability to endure the daily tribulations of food rationing and shortage during the war Such scarcity of materials allowed Braque to explore the space between objects a subject that had preoccupied him throughout his career In the artist s own words Objects For me there are no such things What counts are relationships They are infinite People are incredible They say to me You have painted this tin of tobacco and this cup And what is between the two It is more important I started by painting a space and then by furnishing it The object is a dead thing It only comes alive when it is activated That is what poetry is don t you see Find the common ground between things A swallow pierces the sky like a dagger The swallow was not what counted There were thousands in the sky But it becomes a dagger You have to subject things to change to stop living on automatic quoted in Nadine Pouillon Isabelle Monod Fontaine Braque uvres de Georges Braque 1882 1963 Mus e Nationale d Art Moderne Centre Georges Pompidou Paris 1982 p 150 Exploring the poetics of the space between Braque developed a pictorial language of forms which interrogated the object s identity through sinuous and cursive lines allowing objects to simultaneously and rhythmically dissolve and float across solid surfaces it seems to me just as difficult to paint the spaces between as the things themselves The space between seems to be as essential an element as what they call the object The subject matter consists precisely of the relationship between these objects and between the object and the intervening spaces How can I say what the picture is of when relationships are always things that change What counts is this transformation ibid pp 150 154 Boasting a prestigious provenance having passed through the hands of gallery owner Alfred Poyet and New York art dealer Sam Salz La Sauci re is a masterful example of Braque s wartime still lifes which typifies the artist s desire to bring to life mundane objects into a spectacular rendering of material that interrogates the two dimensional surface of painting into a dynamic play on space and fields of vision This work also previously belonged to Alexander Elisabeth Lewyt whose exceptional taste ingenuity and creativity brought about one of the most celebrated collections of late 19th and early 20th century European art Alexander Lewyt was a visionary inventor and entrepreneur who famously invented the clip on bow tie and his own eponymous vacuum cleaner Together with his wife Elisabeth Alexander shared a passion for art collecting paintings by C zanne Degas Bonnard Renoir and most famously The Man with the Axe by Paul Gauguin The philanthropic couple would also donate many paintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York

Cecilia Bengolea has created a small cheap Video/Film on   in the modern year of 2020.0 Despite the idiosyncratic drum machine beats the recognizable electronic sounds and the patois lyrics dancehall isn t a unified musical genre but refers to the kind of music played at Jamaican night clubs dance halls in general Born out of reggae and ragga music dancehall is tied closely to the modern cultural identity of Jamaica The remarkably expressive choreographies seen in Bengolea s film are testimony to a culture where dancing is not relegated to nightclubs but is celebrated in the streets In this intimate portrait filmed between 2014 and 2019 in Kingston Spanish Town and Bog Walk Jamaica Bengolea explores the Caribbean island s art community whose output revolves around physical expression and movement Portraits of the dancers including of the renowned Jamaican dancer Shelly Belly are spliced between the dance performance sections Cecilia Bengolea born 1979 in Buenos Aires is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice merges video choreography and sculpture drawing on various styles of dancing from street and archaic ritual dances to contemporary choreography She has made her investigations into dancehall culture a major focus in her recent work Through dance Bengolea creates what she calls animated sculptures using it to express an existing identity but also as an abstraction of the self and to create new meaning where the body as a medium is both object and subject She lives and works in Paris Trotz der eigenwilligen Drum Machine Beats der wiedererkennbaren elektronischen Kl nge und der Texte im Patois Dialekt ist Dancehall kein einheitliches Genre sondern bezieht sich allgemein auf die Musik die in jamaikanischen Nachtclubs den Dance Halls gespielt wird Dancehall entstand aus der Reggae und Ragga Musik und ist eng mit der modernen kulturellen Identit t Jamaikas verbunden Die ausdrucksstarken Choreografien in Bengoleas Film zeugen von einer Kultur in der das Tanzen nicht auf die Nachtclubs beschr nkt ist sondern auf der Strasse zelebriert wird In diesem intimen Portr t welches zwischen 2015 und 2019 in Kingston und Bog Walk Jamaika gedreht wurde erkundet Bengolea die Kunstgemeinde der Karibikinsel deren Schaffen sich um k rperlichen Ausdruck und Bewegung dreht Portr ts der T nzerinnen und T nzer darunter auch dem ber hmten jamaikanischen T nzer Shelly Belly werden zwischen die Tanzperformances eingef gt Cecilia Bengolea geboren 1979 in Buenos Aires verbindet in ihrem multidisziplin ren Schaffen Video Choreografie und Skulptur miteinander und setzt sich in ihren Arbeiten mit verschiedenen Tanzstilen auseinander von Strassentanz bis zu archaischen Ritualt nzen und zeitgen ssischen Choreografien Ein Schwerpunkt ihrer j ngsten Arbeit ist die Erforschung der Dancehall Kultur Mit Hilfe des Tanzes schafft Bengolea so genannte animierte Skulpturen mit denen sie einerseits die bestehende Identit t der tanzenden Person zum Ausdruck bringt aber durch die Abstraktion von deren Selbst auch eine neue Bedeutungsebene erschafft in welcher der K rper als Medium sowohl Objekt als auch Subjekt ist Sie lebt und arbeitet in Paris 
Georges Braque has created a small expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1955.0 Braque s ground breaking invention and consequent exploration of Cubism in the first decades of the 20th Century would influence the rest of his career and artistic production From his return from the First World War through to his death in 1963 Braque built on the principles he had established with Picasso in Cubism predominantly within the framework of the still life Cruche cahier de musique bouteille executed in 1924 shows the developments Braque made and the way in which he evolved his style Like those early Cubist works composition has been prioritised over colour with the Frenchman more interested in the way in which each object reacts and relates to the others than in creating a light and decorative work of art Equally the fragmentation of objects continued to infiltrate his post war production with the jug presented on the left of the composition being cut in half by the shadow Not only were these values continued after Cubism ended but a similar subject matter often emerged within Braque s later paintings In many of the works executed in the 1940s for example we find Braque is still interested in some of the same objects only this time painting them in new ways Nature morte la pipe painted in 1942 beautifully combines traditional French painting with Cubist painting Here we see a pipe a bunch of grapes and a wine glass all subjects that become synonymous with Braque s Cubist works However these objects are then juxtaposed with more traditional items such as the loaf of bread a slice of cheese and a carafe The style has quite clearly changed but there is always a sense of continuation within his general uvre Braque would remain faithful to still life painting but enjoyed experimenting and developing ideas Comparing La sauci re with La th i re grise two works executed in the 1940s and 1950s one is instantly struck by the difference between them La sauci re is a playful colourful and inventive still life using a degree of spatial ambiguity and using the shadows to create layered and intricate compositions Thanks to the handle end of the fork combined with a shadow Braque is able to create the form of a palette a leitmotif in his later works However 13 years later when Braque is painting La th i re grise he employs an entirely different palette and structure to create a more ambient and less controlled work Boundaries are blurred bright colours are abandoned and yet it remains within the same category as the previous work a still life Throughout his life Braque would remain faithful to this style of painting but constantly changing and exploring developing and pushing the boundaries of his work whilst nonetheless keeping those early Cubist values

Alexander Tovborg has created a medium cheap Painting on Acrylic on bed linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Taking as his starting point history mythology religion as well as written and oral narratives Alexander Tovborg draws on the stories that have come before us in order to explore and re contextualise classical archetypes In looking at the ways through which we have built our narratives in the past he proposes a new reading of our current social and political situation examining who we are and where we find ourselves today His laborious and layered technique can be seen as a kind of rhythmic practice which allows Tovborg to submerse himself in various worlds creating a kind of visual language that runs throughout the work span ning different series and figures This visual language connects the work but also connects the differing narratives reminding us of the similarities which run through many of the world s origin stories

Marc Vaux has created a medium cheap Painting on Acrylic on MDF in the modern year of 2019.0 Marc Vaux first gained recognition in 1960 when his work was shown in the ground breaking Situation exhibition alongside Robyn Denny William Turnbull Bernard Cohen and others showing large scale purely abstract paintings in response to the new American painting that had recently been shown in London for the first time Vaux first began making wall constructions in 1977 subsequently his work has been defined as both minimalist and constructivist but it is his abiding interest in colour and light which is at the core of his project the works exhibited here are the latest in the long line of his inquiry into the relationship between colour light and form Although at first seeming industrial and cool our physical and emotional relationship to the shifting effects of light on colour elevate these works lifting them into something altogether more transcendental Colour is known to have a direct effect upon the central nervous system human sensibility arguably the most effective modifiers of human response over sound and touch it can be a pure visual experience equivalent to any other experience I see no reason why colour can t equate with melody and be as memorable Marc Vaux quoted in Wiedel Kaufmann Ben 2011 Marc Vaux New Paintings Triptychs and Ovals 
Xavier Veilhan has created a large nominal Sculpture on Acrylic concrete, Birch plywood, varnish in the modern year of 2021.0  This new work is very important to me because it is gradually developing into a new series of works where the idea is a bit like in faceted sculptures mainly interested in the posture we reveal forms which are recognized as being human forms but that are more or less altered to correspond to our perception of these forms We recognize in them a silhouette which is at the limit of our field of vision and whose presence is almost only palpable as it is blurred in the background We apply to a three dimensional shape a visual disturbance effect which we usually experience in two dimensional images this is what s interesting to bring into the field of the image a three dimensional shape I had already done this with certain mobiles that offer with ambiguity flat shapes and rounded shapes side by side

Henri Matisse has created a small nominal Prints & Multiples on Lithograph on Japon paper in the classic year of 1913.0 Henri Matisse was a French artist known for both his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship He was a draughtsman printmaker and sculptor but is known primarily as a painter Matisse is commonly regarded along with Pablo Picasso as one of the artists who best helped to define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture Along with Picasso Matisse helped to define and influence radical contemporary art in the 20th century Although he was initially labelled a Fauve wild beast by the 1920s he was being hailed as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting His mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing displayed in a body of work spanning over a half century won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art This abruptly cropped study of a nude epitomises Matisse s aim of radically simplifying form he wrote of his approach to the figure I will condense the meaning of the body by seeking its essential lines Lithography allowed his draughtsmanship a freedom which other printmaking techniques could not here the sweeping outlines of the figure stripped of extraneous detail bring the white space of the paper to life The paring away of detail gives great expressive power to slight variations in the thickness of the lines

Marie Lund has created a large nominal Sculpture on Clay, copper, rubber and iron in the modern year of 2020.0 Marie Lund s practice poetically exposes imprints and reactionary forces as she explores the place and moment of intersection where different objects meet the external world Working between sculpture and installation Lund uses a variety of materials such as textiles found objects cement wood copper and other natural materials Lund thoughtfully manipulates these elements as the physical traces of her process are left visible for us to find in the forms she creates Leading us down a path of new experiences and new perceptions she draws out the sublime from the ordinary In so doing Marie Lund s works have a distinctly atmospheric quality about them as if the dichotomies between form and content internal and external the body and the materi al which are explored in her work can be felt throughout the space It is within this tangible feeling that Lund invites us to explore showing us a world which has the sensation of being at the same time both familiar and unexpected

Julie Lænkholm has created a medium cheap Mixed Media on Natural dye on silk, cotton, wool in the modern year of 2021.0 Julie L nkholm s practice has its roots in the ideas and the methods centred around collective learning Exploring techniques and practices which have been traditionally been passed down orally from generation to generation L nkholm activates a predominantly female driven history which has been forgotten or otherwise actively ignored Using materials such as wool silk and denim L nkholm treats them with natural plant based dyes using historic methods The specificity and the technical backdrop of this process comes through to create a very tactile three dimensional feeling that emanates from the work unlocking a kind of atmospheric presence that can be readily sensed The works feel as if they are in continual evolution as if they remain alive long after they seem to be finished We become participants of the work activating the work while the work simultaneously activates us There is a generosity inherent in L nkholm practice Works are presented in a way that imparts its process onwards and in so doing imparts the knowledge that is transmitted with it The connections and interaction with the works adds to this consciousness as we find ourselves becoming integrated into this collective learning process 
Alma Allen has created a small cheap Sculpture on bronze in the modern year of 2021.0 Psychologically charged and compulsively expressive Alma Allen s works evoke a curiosity regarding the life of objects and the ways in which form and material can circumnavigate the utility of language Known for his distillation of diverse organic references the artist s works simultaneously invite and resist classification Often realized in stone wood or bronze materials hand selected from quarries or foraged from landscapes in the area surrounding his studio the works emit a mysterious and ineffable life force These abstracted biomorphic shapes feel talismanic not only in their atmospheric qualities but also by way of their playfulness bronze sculptures appear impossibly malleable even liquid wood and stone grain patterns are accented to highlight their material history Whichever medium Allen chooses the works final forms and their particular outcrops and eccentricities seem as though they have been conjured by the artist during their making born of a wordless conversation between sculptor and object The artist s hybrid process encompasses preindustrial methods of hand shaping and carving alongside advanced 21st century technology After repeatedly reworking finger scale clay maquettes Allen will employ as needed a self built robotic device for translation into large scale works finished with an impeccable softness that belies their weight and density A bronze foundry constructed in the artist s studio in Tepoztl n Mexico enables Allen to complete works onsite This instinctive shaping of resistant material draws upon both the process based conceits of Surrealist automatism and the formal inventiveness of Constantin Brancusi and Samuel Beckett Alma Allen participated in the 2014 Whitney Biennial where he gained recognition and a wider discovery of his work Recent group exhibitions include the de Saisset Museum Santa Clara CA and Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum Ridgefield CT In Conversation Alma Allen J B Blunk a two person exhibition that began at the Palm Springs Art Museum Palm Springs CA February 2018 traveled to the Nevada Museum of Art in Spring 2019 
Liam Everett has created a medium nominal Painting on   in the modern year of 2021.0 Liam Everett s abstract mixed media painting and sculpture result from a process of steadfast and repetitious application and erasure employing non traditional methods to apply and caustic substances to remove painstakingly developed layers of paint and composition Inspired by the dynamic alchemy of the natural environment in California this method makes plain the interactive properties of the substances on the canvas how they counteract preserve or react to one another In this way Everett s investigative procedure laser focused on the subtle behavior of his materials becomes akin to the scientific assaying of chemical and mineral substances in order to determine purity or the limits of stability In the studio the artist develops this process by imposing physical obstructions demanding exaggerated levels of adaptation and effort that recall the straight faced farce and gesturality of absurdist theatre Everett brings the body into the problem solving inherent in art making destabilizing and actualizing all at once The studio space then is akin to a rehearsal space in which progression and perpetual motion never quite reach a reliable resolution The toil of this circuitous working method is imbued in the work revealing itself on the canvas as a complex material and metaphysical depth The distillation of the studio s physical and ephemeral characteristics constitutes an important aspect of the artist s practice That which finds expression as work on canvas originates as the inherent dimensions of the structure of the space the proportion of a window direction of its light and the makeshift tools found nearby or inside Time spent in the studio corralling these native elements and learning their individual insistences on translation through the work acts as Everett s primary vehicle for developing its direction In this way what remains is an indexical record of the artist s labor and practice Everett has previously collaborated with choreographers and dancers during major exhibitions to activate the motion inherent in the works For the artist s 2017 installation at SFMOMA Everett invited dance partners for performative actions twice weekly incorporating a sculptural staging element that further developed his investigations into the influence of emotive environments 
A Kassen has created a large expensive Sculpture on Bronze in the modern year of 2021.0 Relying purely on the chemical and physical reactions of natural elements A Kassen s Bronze Pour series is created by pouring small amounts of hot liquid bronze directly into the water The bronze cools upon impact creating small unpredictable and unexpected shapes which are scanned and cast on a larger scale in bronze The artists hands are notably absent in the shaping of the works They are necessarily abstract yet they retain a referential quality to them as we instantly try and place them and find recognisable sources for their imagery Reminiscent of modern sculptures Bronze Pour retains a kind of biomorphic form that adds to this ambiguity 
Elliott Hundley has created a small nominal Mixed Media on encaustic, paper, plastic, pins, photographs, foam and linen on panel in the modern year of 2021.0 Elliott Hundley expands the traditional notions of collage and assemblage in a multidisciplinary practice of painting drawing sculpture and photography that synthesizes ancient epics futuristic narratives and contemporary realities The resulting works resemble theatrical landscapes that delve into the artist s psyche reflecting Hundley s desire to create a new personal mythology Moving fluidly across media the artist utilizes found materials as various as bamboo polystyrene steel embroidered fabric and ceramics Works on canvas are constructed from layers of meticulously compiled source material and mixed media elements affixed using industrial fabric pins frequently shaped by painterly marks that recall the sweeping dynamism of gestural abstraction Often these works include text fragments a boisterous medley of voices both literary and colloquial The results evoke operatic backdrops battle advancement maps or montages of the eternal present What from a distance appears as a tangled frenzy of color and form is revealed on closer inspection as a scrupulously organized ecosystem of smaller scale components much like a city seen from above in the darkness The gradual accumulation of imagery for an initially undetermined use is a critical element of the artist s process At his studio in Los Angeles Hundley presides over a vast archive of two and three dimensional materials collated from books magazines and establishments in his local neighborhood Categorized alphabetically and according to color or mood these materials are brought into dialogue with Hundley s own photography of his family and friends whom the artist dresses and directs as if characters from a play While some are evidently protagonists constituting a focal point on the canvas others lay among dense folds of visual information assuming the role of a face in a crowd or phantom figures arising from unknowable depths Hundley leverages an abiding knowledge of classical mythology and literature to weave a fabric of allusions informing projects such as his 2011 solo exhibition at the Wexner Center for the Arts Ohio which travelled to the Nasher Sculpture Center Dallas and took on the Ancient Greek tragedy The Bacchae by Euripides as its subject matter In 2006 the artist s installation at the Hammer Museum Los Angeles referenced Greek figures Aphrodite Medea and Penelope and 2016 17 Hundley presented solo exhibitions based on Antonin Artaud s surrealist 1933 play There Is No More Firmament His first solo exhibition at Kasmin scheduled for September 2021 takes its inspiration from Jean Genet s 1957 play The Balcony In 2019 Hundley inaugurated the exhibition series Open House at MOCA Los Angeles exploring how the visual and material logic of collage has informed artists in MOCA s collection as well as his own practice In Fall 2021 Hundley will unveil a new 40 ft mural as part of contemporary art triennial Prospect New Orleans

Pamela Rosenkranz has created a small nominal Installation on Ekdysian robot snake skin, kirigami cut PVC, LED light in the modern year of 2021.0 Pamela Rosenkranz s Healers are informed by her research into recent advancements in biorobotics and in particular snakebots which are used to augment human capabilities The complex tasks that these machines are asked to perform range from internal surgical procedures to search and rescue missions scientific research in contaminated areas and deep water missions such as the maintenance of oil drilling platforms Embodying the supernatural qualities of the snakebot while also taking on a natural snake s appearance and behavior the Healers activate the adaptive and manifold symbolic meanings of the serpent which includes a reference to healing via the Rod of Asclepius the Greek god of medicine through its technical incorporation In so doing Rosenkranz raises questions about the natural and the real during an epoch that has seen the transformation of innumerable achievements of nature into technical copies The Healers were presented in 2019 at the Sharjah Biennial 14 Leaving the Echo Chamber and the Okayama Art Summit If the Snake as well as in Rosenkranz s 2021 solo exhibition House of Meme at the Kunsthaus Bregenz Healer Skins Moon Water Lodge appears here as the shed skin of a robotic snake that has molted 
Jaume Plensa has created a medium expensive Sculpture on Steel painted white in the modern year of 2021.0 The work of renowned Spanish artist Jaume Plensa is unified by themes of humanity perspective and duality and a celebration of the universal spirit His search for visual expressions of calm and introspection are communicated across his practice from monumental public works to intimately scaled sculptures In Australia Plensa employs language as a metaphor for the shared humanity of the world s seemingly divergent cultures Made in stainless steel painted white a latticework of characters from different alphabets come together to form a figure resting in a meditative pose Plensa s use of graphemes from nine different alphabets Japanese Chinese Arabic Greek Cyrillic Hindi Tamil Hebrew and Latin characters celebrates the exchange of ideas and compassion through language The artist furthers this notion of commonality of language through his use of the human figure as a universal symbol His figurative work centers on the belief that humans are not merely bodies but space space for spirit mind and contemplation 
Leon Polk Smith has created a small expensive Painting on Paint on canvas board in the classic year of 1970.0 Leon Polk Smith was an American painter heralded for his lifelong commitment to simplified shapes brilliant colors and minimal pressurized compositions a commitment that predated influenced and outlasted the heydays of Hard edge painting and Minimalism After graduating from Oklahoma State College in 1934 Smith moved to New York for three consecutive summers starting in 1936 to pursue his graduate studies in art and education at the Teachers College at Columbia University He later attributed his encounters with works by Piet Mondrian Constantin Brancusi and Hans Arp during this time as formative in his artistic development In his hard edged paintings Smith sought to push the gridded geometry of Mondrian into curved compositions that celebrated optical tension and restraint Smith s work achieved a commanding level of confidence and originality after a revelation occurred to him in the form of a sporting goods catalog in 1954 1 Inspired by drawings of soccer balls tennis balls and baseballs Smith came to understand how to lend a flat surface the volume density and mass of things in the world how in short to get his painting to project objecthood 2 For a 1958 show poet and art critic John Ashbery observed Smith s originality is in his subtle warping of geometrical forms the almost imperceptible straightening of curves and the throwing of perpendiculars and parallels just out of whack which results in an effect that is neither two nor three dimensional but vibrates agitatedly between the two This comes as a surprise after the classic calm the pictures seem to have at a first glance 3In the late 1950s and by the early 1960s Smith had developed one of his major bodies of work his Correspondences These works typically consist of two vibrantly colored painted shapes defined by a precise but often irregular contour allowing for the interchangeability of positive and negative space a temporal edge and a taut vitality Although not an explicit Correspondence the present work maintains and develops some of the achievements of the artist s earlier series 1 Mary Murray in Geometry in Motion Leon Polk Smith Works on Paper New York Munson Williams Proctor Arts Institute 2017 p 14 2 Jonathan Katz in Geometry in Motion Leon Polk Smith Works on Paper New York Munson Williams Proctor Arts Institute 2017 p 22 3 John Ashbery Leon Polk Smith in Artnews 56 January 1958 p 9 
Adolph Gottlieb has created a small expensive Painting on Oil on masonite in the classic year of 1952.0 In the early 1950s after thoroughly experimenting with ancient myths and symbols in his 1940s Pictographs Adolph Gottlieb began to open up the compositional structure of his paintings in his Imaginary Landscapes allowing an emptier swath of space with a distinct back and foreground and hovering above a clearly demarcated horizon line to replace the contained all over frameworks of the earlier Pictographs and Labyrinths The upper more open register of the Imaginary Landscapes then acts as a balancing force when placed adjacent to its lower counterpart Even in the present work in which the lower register the nadir or point on the celestial sphere situated directly below an observer fills up most of the compositional space the upper register or zenith still provides a formal counterpoint In the early 1950s Gottlieb resolved the drama of restraint with his more fruitful invention the Imaginary Landscapes in which the canvas is divided into two sections that contrast and at times conflict with one another Nadir of the early 1950s makes an art of opposition and contention as fragmentary but distinct shapes above echo yet repudiate a block of painterly roughened chaotic flow below 1The present Imaginary Landscape is closely related to a number of larger oil paintings done on canvas c 1952 including works housed in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art New York the Whitney Museum of American Art New York and The Albright Knox Art Gallery Buffalo New York The present composition was also further explored in a larger 1952 canvas of the same name 1 Adolph Gottlieb in Montreal in Adolph Gottlieb Important Works Montreal Landau Fine Art 1993 p 5

Knut Henrik Henriksen has created a small cheap Installation on Plaster, marble dust, styrofoam, paint, brass, various dimensions in the modern year of 2021.0 Knut Henriksen takes inspiration from the local tradition of Auf der Walz journeyman years a historic ritual that occurs at the end of the apprenticeship of young craftspeople who travel for years offering their services in return for room and board The carpenters of Auf der Walz practice and distinguish varied techniques and craftsmanship from different areas of the country until they achieve a comprehensive understanding By adapting the formal language of traditional craftsmanship to the logic of contemporary production Henriksen opens the rule bound crafts to play and experimentation Henriksen s use of cheap artificial materials become a means to draw attention to the construction of emotional meaning within architectural space The garden of the Antikenmuseum holds copies of classical Roman sculptures that become protagonists in the artist s drama of staged emotions Henriksen plays with the effect inherent to the material and form of these by considering the ways in which cheap efficient materials can evoke specific moods and emotions The classical sculptures suggest an idyllic atmosphere that becomes enhanced by Henriksen s sunset made from Styrofoam manipulated to appear like rustic wood a material used to create warmth comfort and a romantic atmosphere This sunset functions as a tableau involving the garden and the drama performed between the classical sculptures a brass necklace decorating Aphrodite of Knidos a white powdered marble structure that nods to Francis Bacon to articulate the emotional drama enacted by Satyr and Hermaphrodite and an old medieval structural figure der Wilder Mann seen in half timbered houses This site specific installation considers the ways in which collective notions of romance and nostalgia manifest and how we retain craftsmanship and historic traditions Henrik Knut Henriksen born 1970 in Oslo works with standardized sizes and formulates sculptures that embrace the concept he has named Architectural Doubts Often these involve raw elements within the exhibition space or technical mistakes and historical changes that have occurred within the building that help give form and size to sculptures Henriksen explains From these doubts that I identify as interesting within a site or building I make sculptures and formulate a kind of monument by organizing different standardized materials from my own architectural heritage Henriksen lives and works in Berlin Das historische Ritual der Walz also der handwerklichen Gesellenjahre bei welchen junge Handwerker innen am Ende der Lehrzeit umherreisen und ihre Dienste gegen Kost und Logis anbieten dient Henriksen als Inspiration f r seine Arbeit Die Zimmerleute verfeinern w hrend der Reise ihre Handwerkskunst in verschiedenen Regionen und L ndern Henriksen macht sich die Formensprache des traditionellen Handwerks zu Nutze und verbindet sie mit der Logik zeitgen ssischer Produktion So ffnet er das regelgebundene Handwerk f r seine Experimente Henriksens gleichzeitige Verwendung von billigen k nstlichen Materialien erm glicht es die Aufmerksamkeit auf die Konstruktion emotionaler Bedeutung im architektonischen Raum zu lenken Die Kopien klassischer r mischer Skulpturen im Garten des Antikenmuseums werden zu Protagonisten im Drama der inszenierten Emotionen des K nstlers Henriksen spielt mit dem Affekt der dem Material und der Form dieser Skulpturen innewohnt indem er zeigt wie diese billigen effizienz optimierten Materialien bestimmte Stimmungen und Gef hle ausl sen Die klassischen Skulpturen suggerieren eine idyllische Atmosph re die durch Henriksens Styropor Sonnenuntergang noch verst rkt wird Das aufgesch umte Material wurde so bearbeitet dass es an rustikales Holz erinnert ein Werkstoff der W rme Behaglichkeit und eine romantische Atmosph re verspricht Dieser Sonnenuntergang fungiert als Tableau das den Garten und das Drama das sich zwischen den klassischen Skulpturen abspielt einrahmt Die Aphrodite von Knidos ist mit einer Messingkette geschm ckt eine Struktur aus weissem gepudertem Marmor spielt auf Francis Bacon an um das emotionale Spiel von Satyr und Hermaphrodite zu evozieren daneben eine alte mittelalterliche Figur genannt der Wilde Mann der oft in Fachwerkh usern zu sehen ist Diese ortsspezifische Installation befasst sich mit der Art und Weise wie sich kollektive Vorstellungen von Romantik und Nostalgie manifestieren und wie wir Handwerkskunst und historische Traditionen weitergeben Henrik Knut Henriksen geb 1970 in Oslo arbeitet mit standardisierten Fertigungsprozessen und formuliert Skulpturen die in das von ihm als Architectural Doubts also architektonische Zweifel bezeichnete Konzept m nden Ein Ansatz der mit Schein und Sein spielt und so versucht die gewohnte Erfahrung von Materialien und Oberfl chen zu durchbrechen Von rohen im Ausstellungsraum eingef gten Elementen ber bewusst gesetzte technische Fehlerstellen bis hin zu Ver nderungen an historischen Geb udesubstanzen findet er unterschiedliche Ansatzpunkte f r seine Interventionen Henriksen erkl rt dass er an interessanten Stellen an einem Ort oder Geb ude mit Skulpturen eine Art Monument des Zweifels formuliere indem er verschiedene standardisierte Prozesse und Materialien aus seinem eigenen architektonischen Erbe mit dem vorhandenen kombiniert Er lebt und arbeitet in Berlin

Lawrence Weiner has created a small expensive Mixed Media on LANGUAGE + THE MATERIALS REFERRED TO in the classic year of 2018.0 A pioneering figure in conceptual art in the 1960s Lawrence Weiner theorized a reconfiguration of traditional parameters of the work of art Weiner developed an aesthetic whose focus as he has put it is on art as an empirical fact of the relationships of objects to objects in relation to human beings and not dependent upon historical precedent for either use or legitimacy These are precisely the characteristic processes of artistic creation thought and language to be investigated Indeed language assumes a real sculptural value in Weiner s works Weiner first made public his Statement of Intent in 1968 Here he posited that the linguistic creation of a work of art was enough for his work to exist The statement reads as follows The artist may construct the work The work may be fabricated The work need not be built Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership

Georges Braque has created a small expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1942.0 Braque s ground breaking invention and consequent exploration of Cubism in the first decades of the 20th Century would influence the rest of his career and artistic production From his return from the First World War through to his death in 1963 Braque built on the principles he had established with Picasso in Cubism predominantly within the framework of the still life Cruche cahier de musique bouteille executed in 1924 shows the developments Braque made and the way in which he evolved his style Like those early Cubist works composition has been prioritised over colour with the Frenchman more interested in the way in which each object reacts and relates to the others than in creating a light and decorative work of art Equally the fragmentation of objects continued to infiltrate his post war production with the jug presented on the left of the composition being cut in half by the shadow Not only were these values continued after Cubism ended but a similar subject matter often emerged within Braque s later paintings In many of the works executed in the 1940s for example we find Braque is still interested in some of the same objects only this time painting them in new ways Nature morte la pipe painted in 1942 beautifully combines traditional French painting with Cubist painting Here we see a pipe a bunch of grapes and a wine glass all subjects that become synonymous with Braque s Cubist works However these objects are then juxtaposed with more traditional items such as the loaf of bread a slice of cheese and a carafe The style has quite clearly changed but there is always a sense of continuation within his general uvre Braque would remain faithful to still life painting but enjoyed experimenting and developing ideas Comparing La sauci re with La th i re grise two works executed in the 1940s and 1950s one is instantly struck by the difference between them La sauci reis a playful colourful and inventive still life using a degree of spatial ambiguity and using the shadows to create layered and intricate compositions Thanks to the handle end of the fork combined with a shadow Braque is able to create the form of a palette a leitmotif in his later works However 13 years later when Braque is painting La th i re grise he employs an entirely different palette and structure to create a more ambient and less controlled work Boundaries are blurred bright colours are abandoned and yet it remains within the same category as the previous work a still life Throughout his life Braque would remain faithful to this style of painting but constantly changing and exploring developing and pushing the boundaries of his work whilst nonetheless keeping those early Cubist values

Georges Mathieu has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1991.0 Across Europe and the United States Georges Mathieu played a decisive role within abstraction during the movement s burgeoning in the late 1940s and early 1950s He departed from the geometrical abstractions that had dominated the previous era with a visual language that favored form over content and gesture over intent and instead aimed for uninhibited creative expression He termed this newfound aesthetic lyrical abstraction after a description of his work by the French critic Jean Jos Marchand in 1947 Mathieu s works are characterized by a calligraphic quality of line which he achieved by using long brushes and applying paint directly from tubes onto the canvas The immediacy and rapid execution of these distinct methods guaranteed the freedom with which he defined his work According to Clement Greenberg Mathieu was the most powerful among his contemporary European painters Mathieu s work has been the subject of numerous retrospectives and is in more than eighty museums and public permanent collections including the Art Institute of Chicago Centre Pompidou Paris the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Washington DC Kunstmuseum Basel Kunsthaus Z rich the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles the Museum of Fine Arts Houston the Museum of Modern Art New York the Mus e National d Art Moderne Paris the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York and the Tate London

Henry Moore has created a small expensive Work on Paper on Chalk, pen and watercolour on paper in the classic year of 1940.0 I so loved my monthly visits to Henry Moore s house and studios deep in the Hertfordshire countryside driving through endless fields to my left and right of rape and wheat and of course sheep grazing I always felt like I was playing truant me the dealer in contemporary art visiting and sitting at the feet of an elder statesman of art a man from a different moment in time But he knew his worth I well remember the very first time he allowed me to buy a group of drawings a dozen or so Most of my visits to Much Hadham were mainly discussing print publishing So he handed me the package and said remember to frame the drawing well even a Michelangelo doesn t look so good without its frame A humble man yes although one who was fully aware of his greatness One day we were in the studio with the working models away from the maquettes and the full scale sculpture Out the corner of my eye I saw a plaster of a strange horse sort of ancient and yet modern in feeling I enthused for ages to Mr Moore and in fact may have even overdone my enthusiasm for the work Mr Moore was pleased I liked it so much A few months later it appeared in bronze completed and shiny and quite streamlined in appearance It was superb Years later one of the sculptor s assistants took me to one side and said Moore was quite unsure about casting the work but my enthusiasm had won him over I may have worked for this art giant but I had also affected art history at least in my small way 
Robert Motherwell has created a small expensive Painting on   Acrylic on canvasboard in the classic year of 1975.0 The paintings of 1975 and 1976 are characterized by a threatening presence that emerges from Goya s late picture with the dog howling from the hill as does Motherwell s Spanish Painting with the Face of a Dog Primordial Sketch whose dark shapes are lit by a sort of halo but where the strong thrust leftward of the central shape balances the horizontal sweep with a vague notion of a cross shape Motherwell says As I entered my sixties I found a certain personal atavism a growing desire for an almost primeval force that has always been more or less latent in some of my work becoming stronger I thought as often of Stonehenge as of Brancusi of Lascaux and Altamira as well as of Guernica of Vikings rather than the Parisians or new Yorkers At Any rate the winter of 1976 was devoted to more barbaric and megalithic images more than perhaps at any time since I first stumbled on the Spanish Elegy theme

Esther Kläs has created a large nominal Installation on resin, pigment, carpet, aluminium, steel in the modern year of 2020.0 A large L shaped white block made of a water based resin floats above the ground opposite a cast aluminum shape Both are suspended from the ceiling by thin threads The elements hover directly above a soft narrow rug The abstract Modernist sculptural elements are presented in a careful balance of weight and density scale and volume creating opposing as much as convergent effects Through their peculiar physicality they retain a uniquely organic and warm appearance Rather than trying to hide it they carry the imprint of their making on their surfaces The relationship between the human body and the presence of the sculptures in the room is central to Kl s work What looks like a large overbearing gesture is actually an intimate investigative confrontation Although Esther Kl s born 1981 in Mainz Germany works in nearly all media she is best known for her large often monolithic sculptures Made from resin plaster Styrofoam or concrete they retain a rough and towering appearance that defies the intimate method of their creation Deliberately using materials that can be worked without tools Kl s shapes her sculptures by hand She lives and works in Barcelona Ein grosser weisser L f rmiger Block aus einem wasserbasierten Harz schwebt ber dem Boden kontrastiert von einer drahtigen Form aus gegossenem Aluminium Beide sind mit d nnen F den von der Decke abgeh ngt Die Elemente schweben ber einem schmalen weichen Teppich dessen Gr sse von den h ngenden Formen abgeleitet ist Die abstrakten modernistisch skulpturalen Elemente erzeugen ein sorgf ltiges Gleichgewicht von Gewicht und Dichte Massstab und Volumen das sowohl gegens tzliche als auch konvergierende Effekte beinhaltet Durch ihre eigent mliche K rperlichkeit bewahren sie eine organische warme Erscheinung Anstatt sie zu verbergen tragen die Formen die Spuren ihrer Entstehung sichtbar auf der Oberfl che Die Beziehung zwischen dem menschlichen K rper und der Pr senz der Skulpturen im Raum ist f r Kl s Arbeit von zentraler Bedeutung Was zuerst wie eine grosse anmassende Geste aussieht stellt sich in Wirklichkeit als eine intime forschende Konfrontation heraus Obwohl Esther Kl s geboren 1981 in Mainz Deutschland in fast allen Medien arbeitet ist sie vor allem f r ihre grossen oft monolithischen Skulpturen bekannt Kl s verwendet bewusst Materialien die sich ohne Werkzeuge bearbeiten lassen und formt ihre Skulpturen von Hand Aus Harz Gips Styropor oder Beton gefertigt haben sie eine raue und gewaltige Erscheinung die der intimen Methode ihrer Entstehung widerspricht Kl s lebt und arbeitet in Barcelona 
Art & Language has created a medium expensive Painting on Canvas and Photostat in the classic year of 1967.0 This very important work was exhibited in the Fondation Antoni Tapies in 1999 and the Tate Britain It is the biggest secret painting they ever made It is signed by Mel Ramsden and dated 1967 8 Imagine trying to paint a painting with monochrome black The painting contains a geometrical form a square positioned symmetrically at the centre of the canvas This square and its background are painted exactly the same black Imagine now a studio with two or three of these paintings hanging on the wall They are all unfinished or rather in a gap between success and the lack of it Imagine one or two friends visiting the artist to talk about this problem of how to finish something by erasing all traces of signification What comes up again and again in conversation is the realisation that such paintings can t be made public without an explanation or some kind of account of their production Imagine that the artist with some encouragement from his friends decides to put all the talk about these paintings up on the wall next to the painting

McArthur Binion has created a medium expensive Other Materials on Oil paint stick and paper on board in the modern year of 2020.0 Distinguished for his minimalist abstract paintings McArthur Binion combines a mastery of elemental materials including crayon oil stick ink and graphite with a highly personal narrative that lies at the foundation of his work A grid of interlacing lines and repetitive strokes in oil stick form the top layer of Binion s paintings both obscuring and revealing the layer of personal markers underneath The base layer of Binion s compositions which he describes as the under conscious is made up of ephemera from the artist s life Photocopies of his birth certificate and passport newspaper clippings excerpts from his address books childhood photos and images from his home state of Mississippi are among the visuals he uses to disseminate the intimate details of his identity relationships and history Refusing categorization while relating to abstraction minimalism and monochromatic painting Binion s practice is rooted in an individual dedication to the process of painting The present work is from the artist s more recent DNA series First begun in 2013 this series typically incorporates copies of Binion s birth certificate or pages from his address book that he used while living in New York in the 1970s and 1980s In the works that employ his address book such as the present painting historical addresses and phone numbers for the likes of Jack Whitten Joanna Pousette Dart and Stanley Whitney all written in Binion s scrawl undergird the form and content In discussing this series Binion noted all those names and numbers I ve had in one book for over twenty years When I was working on those I was reliving every day of my life Every name every face it s emotional you think of things and you feel things 1 Binion s version of the grid pushes back against the perfectly straight lines and seemingly content absent abstraction of his Minimalist predecessors and contemporaries challenging attempts to unlink abstraction from questions of location and identity 21 Interviews McArthur Binion on Memory and Narrative in Abstraction in Artforum January 25 2019 https www artforum com interviews mcarthur binion on memory and narrative in abstraction 78403 2 Ian Bourland Reviews McArthur Binion in Art in America March 1 2019 https www artnews com art in america aia reviews mcarthur binion 62633 
David Hockney has created a small nominal Prints & Multiples on iPad drawing printed on paper in the classic year of 2011.0 Throughout his career David Hockney has embraced new technologies in his practice especially those developed with mass use and accessibility in mind In the 1980s and 1990s he made use of the Polaroid Xerox fax machine and Macintosh computer in his work and he began using Photoshop as early as 2007 Most recently Hockney has taken up the iPhone and iPad as his means for art making utilizing Brushes and other applications developed for drawing on touchscreens Starting in 2009 he began to draw hundreds of images on his iPhone and as soon as it was introduced in 2010 on his iPad The iPad specifically allowed him to work at a larger scale and with increased detail and the playback function of both devices offered him and others the possibility to retroactively watch the progression by which his drawings were made While living in Bridlington on the coast of Yorkshire in 2009 and the early 2010s Hockney took up the iPhone and iPad repeatedly producing a series of often intimate and impromptu drawings of the everyday He would keep a tablet on his bedside table so that he might be able to draw his view out the window his trousers strewn across a chair an ashtray or perhaps a vase of flowers as he was seeing them each morning and evening At first he only shared his iPhone and iPad drawings with friends via email Though soon enough he began to select a number of drawings to be printed at a larger scale for exhibition The present work is from a series of twenty three of the artist s selected iPhone and iPad drawings each printed in editions of twenty five

Georges Braque has created a small expensive Painting on Oil and sand on canvas in the classic year of 1924.0 Braque s ground breaking invention and consequent exploration of Cubism in the first decades of the 20th Century would influence the rest of his career and artistic production From his return from the First World War through to his death in 1963 Braque built on the principles he had established with Picasso in Cubism predominantly within the framework of the still life Cruche cahier de musique bouteille executed in 1924 shows the developments Braque made and the way in which he evolved his style Like those early Cubist works composition has been prioritised over colour with the Frenchman more interested in the way in which each object reacts and relates to the others than in creating a light and decorative work of art Equally the fragmentation of objects continued to infiltrate his post war production with the jug presented on the left of the composition being cut in half by the shadow Not only were these values continued after Cubism ended but a similar subject matter often emerged within Braque s later paintings In many of the works executed in the 1940s for example we find Braque is still interested in some of the same objects only this time painting them in new ways Nature morte la pipe painted in 1942 beautifully combines traditional French painting with Cubist painting Here we see a pipe a bunch of grapes and a wine glass all subjects that become synonymous with Braque s Cubist works However these objects are then juxtaposed with more traditional items such as the loaf of bread a slice of cheese and a carafe The style has quite clearly changed but there is always a sense of continuation within his general uvre Braque would remain faithful to still life painting but enjoyed experimenting and developing ideas Comparing La sauci re with La th i re grise two works executed in the 1940s and 1950s one is instantly struck by the difference between them La sauci re is a playful colourful and inventive still life using a degree of spatial ambiguity and using the shadows to create layered and intricate compositions Thanks to the handle end of the fork combined with a shadow Braque is able to create the form of a palette a leitmotif in his later works However 13 years later when Braque is painting La th i re grise he employs an entirely different palette and structure to create a more ambient and less controlled work Boundaries are blurred bright colours are abandoned and yet it remains within the same category as the previous work a still life Throughout his life Braque would remain faithful to this style of painting but constantly changing and exploring developing and pushing the boundaries of his work whilst nonetheless keeping those early Cubist values Not only were these values continued after Cubism ended but a similar subject matter often emerged within Braque s later paintings In many of the works executed in the 1940s for example we find Braque is still interested in some of the same objects only this time painting them in new ways Nature morte la pipe painted in 1942 beautifully combines traditional French painting with Cubist painting Here we see a pipe a bunch of grapes and a wine glass all subjects that become synonymous with Braque s Cubist works However these objects are then juxtaposed with more traditional items such as the loaf of bread a slice of cheese and a carafe The style has quite clearly changed but there is always a sense of continuation within his general uvre Braque would remain faithful to still life painting but enjoyed experimenting and developing ideas Comparing La sauci re with La th i re grise two works executed in the 1940s and 1950s one is instantly struck by the difference between them La sauci re is a playful colourful and inventive still life using a degree of spatial ambiguity and using the shadows to create layered and intricate compositions Thanks to the handle end of the fork combined with a shadow Braque is able to create the form of a palette a leitmotif in his later works However 13 years later when Braque is painting La th i re grise he employs an entirely different palette and structure to create a more ambient and less controlled work Boundaries are blurred bright colours are abandoned and yet it remains within the same category as the previous work a still life Throughout his life Braque would remain faithful to this style of painting but constantly changing and exploring developing and pushing the boundaries of his work whilst nonetheless keeping those early Cubist values

Callum Innes has created a medium nominal Painting on Oil on Linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Callum Innes is known for luminous abstractions that push at the fundamentals of painting pigment surface and space Composed of opaque sections juxtaposed with thin translucent washes that appear almost permeable his paintings invoke a dynamic conversation between presence and absence Innes generally works in series allowing his methods to build upon each other and evolve gradually while he works on several paintings at the same time Untitled Lamp Black Crimson Red 2021 appears at first to be only two colours but a closer look reveals a range of complex hues and shades Innes started by painting the entire canvas black before applying repeated washes of turpentine to remove paint from part of the surface leaving all but the faintest vestigial traces of pigment The remaining black part of the canvas is then painted with another colour resulting in a luminous shifting surface that evokes different registers of time 
Rodrigo Hernández has created a small nominal Installation on Hand-hammered brass various dimensions in the modern year of 2019.0 Instead of painting Rodrigo Hern ndez hammers his motifs into brass plates creating flat reliefs a confrontational encounter with the material to be executed with sensitivity and precision The hard smooth and nonpourous material flexes under the targeted and well dosed intervention to produce images with a three dimensionality that gives the panels a plastic liveliness Formally the figures and motifs are kept simple drawn with soft round lines the luminous gold adding warmth The gleaming semi reliefs form a series that runs through the exhibition space like a narrative path Gestures of intimacy delicate touches and moments of togetherness are visible thanks to the artist s careful hand Like the reliefs of early Renaissance religious motifs the golden ground creates a devotional grandeur that further enhances the intimacy of the subjects However they are simple everyday scenes with a poetic and sensitive quality rather than myths and heroic deeds Rodrigo Hern ndez born 1983 in Mexico City likes to experiment with classical arts and crafts The Japanese school he attended as a child in Mexico City influenced the visual language In Japanese scripture words are often represented by single symbols that depict what they signify However new meanings emerge when these symbols are combined meanings not contained in the original single characters Hern ndez conjoins multiple media to create expansive narrative installations often made of simple materials such as paper wood or metal to trace recurring ideas in the history of art and literature He lives and works in Lisbon and Mexico City Anstatt zu malen h mmert Rodrigo Hern ndez seine Motive in Messingplatten eine Konfrontation mit dem Material die mit Feingef hl und Pr zision ausgef hrt werden muss Das harte glatte und porenlose Material biegt sich unter dem gezielten und wohldosierten Eingriff und erzeugt flache Reliefs deren Dreidimensionalit t den Platten eine plastische Lebendigkeit verleiht Formal sind die Figuren und Motive einfach gehalten mit weichen runden Linien gezeichnet wobei das leuchtende Gold W rme verleiht Die schimmernden Halbreliefs bilden eine Serie die sich wie ein narrativer Weg durch den Ausstellungsraum zieht Gesten der Intimit t zarte Ber hrungen und Momente der Zweisamkeit werden dank der bedachten Handarbeit des K nstlers sichtbar Wie bei den Reliefs religi ser Motive der Fr hrenaissance erzeugt der Goldgrund eine and chtige Erhabenheit die die Intimit t der Motive noch verst rkt Es handelt sich jedoch nicht um Mythen und Heldentaten sondern um einfache allt gliche Szenen von poetischer und sensibler Qualit t Rodrigo Hern ndez geboren 1983 in Mexiko Stadt experimentiert gerne mit klassischem Kunsthandwerk Die japanische Schule die er als Kind in Mexiko Stadt besuchte hat seine Bildsprache beeinflusst In der japanischen Schrift werden W rter oft durch einzelne Symbole dargestellt die bildlich darstellen was sie bedeuten Wenn diese Symbole jedoch kombiniert werden entstehen neue Bedeutungen die in den urspr nglichen einzelnen Zeichen nicht enthalten sind Hern ndez verbindet mehrere Medien um ausgedehnte narrative Installationen zu schaffen die oft aus einfachen Materialien wie Papier Holz oder Metall bestehen um wiederkehrende Ideen in der Kunst und Literaturgeschichte nachzuzeichnen Er lebt und arbeitet in Lissabon und Mexiko Stadt

Hanne Lippard has created a small cheap Installation on Three-channel sound-file, scent-diffusers, peppermint oil in the modern year of 2019.0 This work has no canvas the room is the frame the voice of the artist is the image Hanne Lippard s work is a performance in absence Played from loudspeakers her voice becomes all the more intimate when we are forced to listen without seeing the actual speaker Through this her voice becomes a vessel for a character partly created by the artist herself partly invented by each listener The work aptly located in the Pharmacy Museum draws on the current health crisis and our own estrangement from breath as a shared value of life as well as a threat Peppermint oil lingers in the air invisibly surrounding the visitors and becoming apparent with every breath Through rhythm and repetition the murmurings call upon us like sermons of misheard and mispronounced words Lippard likes to speak in fragments and pieces weaving poems out of the seemingly unrelated strings of words through connotative sequences But only seemingly The meditative instructions to the audience delivered like incantations mantras recipes or formulas lead to a series of very concrete and personal questions where we are forced to turn away from the speaker s voice to investigate ourselves with painful scrutiny Have you ever swept something under the rug Hanne Lippard born 1984 in Milton Keynes UK uses language specifically her voice as her main medium From printed works and audio installations to films and performances Lippard is interested in the discrepancies between the written and the spoken word but also in instances of semantic and phonetic closeness Even language made by bots and algorithms has found its way into her text and time based works The often rhythmic nature of the poems and texts created through repetition mispronunciations and scrambled sentences and sometimes backed by percussive music gives them a strikingly visual feel Lippard lives and works in Berlin Dieses Werk ben tigt keine Leinwand und keinen Sockel Der Raum dient als Rahmen die Stimme der K nstlerin erzeugt das Bild Lippards Werk ist eine Performance in Abwesenheit Die Stimme die aus Lautsprechern erklingt wird umso intimer als wir gezwungen sind ihr zuzuh ren ohne die Sprecherin selbst zu sehen Auf diese Weise wird ihre Stimme zum Gef ss f r eine Figur die zu gleichen Teilen von der K nstlerin und von den Zuh rer Innen erschaffen wird Das Werk das sich passenderweise im Pharmaziemuseum befindet bezieht sich auf die wachsende Entfremdung gegen ber unserem Atem in der aktuellen Gesundheitskrise Der Atem als fundamentales Merkmal von Leben wurde zur Bedrohung f r dasselbe Pfefferminz l liegt in der Luft f r die Besucher unsichtbar aber mit jedem Atemzug evident Durch den Rhythmus und die Wiederholung erscheinen Lippards Worte wie eine Predigt aus falsch geh rten und oder falsch ausgesprochenen Worten Sie spricht in Bruchst cken und Fragmenten und webt aus scheinbar zusammenhanglosen Wortketten durch konnotative Sequenzen Gedichte Aber nur scheinbar Die meditativen Anweisungen an das Publikum die wie Beschw rungsformeln Mantras Rezepte oder Formeln vorgetragen werden f hren zu einer Reihe sehr konkreter und pers nlicher Fragen bei denen wir gezwungen sind uns von der Stimme der Sprecherin abzuwenden um uns selbst mit schmerzhafter Genauigkeit zu untersuchen Have you ever swept something under the rug Hanne Lippard geboren 1984 in Milton Keynes Grossbritannien verwendet Sprache insbesondere ihre eigene Stimme als Hauptmedium In gedruckten Arbeiten Audioinstallationen Filmen und Performances untersucht Lippard f r die Diskrepanzen zwischen dem geschriebenen und dem gesprochenen Wort wie auch f r die semantischen und phonetischen Beziehungen der W rter untereinander Auch k nstliche Sprache von Bots und Algorithmen erzeugt finden Eingang in Lippards text und zeitbasierte Arbeiten Die oft rhythmische Natur der Gedichte und Texte erschaffen aus Wiederholung bewusst unklarer Aussprache und verst ckelten S tze und manchmal von perkussiver Musik untermalt verleiht den Worten einen fast visuellen Charakter Lippard lebt und arbeitet in Berlin 
Mike Nelson has created a large nominal Installation on Sleeping bag and plexiglas, a variety of currency in the classic year of 2013.0 A sleeping bag is placed on the ground and enclosed in a plexiglass vitrine appearing almost shrine like yet with a slot for coins the sculpture becomes akin to a donation box where the coins fall in the place where the head would have lain opening up the reading to wider issues around homelessness charity and the gaze Mike Nelson s works are often drawn to an archetypal yet absent figure of the lone wanderer with this particular work addressing the self and our relationship to the wider world on levels both universal and individual It was made by Nelson in memory of a close friend and collaborator fellow artist Erlend Williamson Williamson died while climbing in the Scottish Highlands in 1996 and it is his sleeping bag from childhood that occupies the plexiglass vitrine For Nelson the death of his friend was a pivotal moment and placed in this location of the Barf sserkirche the work takes on the quality of a relic reminding us of the powerful material traces of those who came before us and offering a tribute to those we have lost While Mike Nelson is known for his expansive installations through which the viewer roams in a state of existential estrangement here the perspective is turned around an intimate sculpture draws us in while powerfully speaking to its wider surroundings Mike Nelson born 1967 in Loughborough UK is an installation artist and sculptor who rose to prominence thanks to his complex warren like installations that explore urban subcultures Drawn to quotidian found objects his arrangements build on hidden narratives and foreground diverse cultural political and literary references He lives and works in London Mike Nelsons Untitled intimate sculpture for a public space 2013 besteht aus einem auf dem Boden liegenden Schlafsack der von einer Plexiglashaube umschlossen wird und nahezu wie ein Schrein wirkt Die Skulptur verf gt ber einen M nzschlitz in der Plexiglashaube wodurch sie zu einer Art Spendenbox wird und gleichzeitig bergreifende Themen wie Obdachlosigkeit N chstenliebe sowie den gesellschaftlichen Blick in den Fokus r ckt Nelsons Arbeiten kreisen oftmals um die archetypische in den Werken zumeist abwesende Figur des einsamen Wanderers In Untitled intimate sculpture for a public space wird dieses bergreifende Motiv mit dem Pers nlichen verschr nkt Nelson schuf das Werk in Gedenken an seinen engen Freund und Kollaborateur den K nstler Erlend Williamson Williamson starb 1996 bei einem Kletterunfall in den schottischen Highlands und der Tod seines Freundes war ein einschneidender Moment f r Nelson Es ist ein Schlafsack aus Williamsons Kindheit der hier unter Plexiglas pr sentiert wird und so an eine Reliquie erinnert die auf die Kraft materieller Spuren aus der Vergangenheit verweist und eine Hommage an diejenigen ist die wir verloren haben Nelson der vor allem f r seine raumgreifenden Installationen bekannt ist welche das Publikum h ufig in einen Zustand der Entfremdung versetzen kehrt die Perspektive hier um Diese sehr intime Skulptur zieht uns an und steht auf eindrucksvolle Weise in Dialog mit ihrer Umgebung Mike Nelson geboren 1967 in Loughborough Grossbritannien ist ein Installationsk nstler und Bildhauer Bekannt wurde er durch seine komplexen oft labyrinthischen Installationen in denen er urbane Subkulturen erkundet Seine Arrangements basieren auf den verborgenen Erz hlungen in den verwendeten Fundst cken und stellen verschiedene kulturelle politische und literarische Bez ge in den Vordergrund Mike Nelson lebt und arbeitet in London

Pedro Wirz has created a large cheap Installation on Wood, wire, used clothes, soil, binder, bitumen glue in the modern year of 2021.0 In the reading room of the library something between a wasp s nest and a butterfly cocoon dangles from the roof beams of the installation space The dark color suggests a mature stage of development maybe an imminent hatching The structure leaves the viewer to guess what creature it might contain Is it benign A hint comes from the title the marimbondo surr o is a type of wasp native to the Amazon rainforest and to the Brazilian region where the artist grew up It is considered very aggressive and dangerous According to Wirz the peculiar shape of the nest that this insect builds is what influenced the shape of the sculpture Also the word surra in Portuguese means a beating The idea of a very dangerous game of pi ata in the library changes from being a surrealistic joke to a deeper issue Wirz has long been interested in the forms of coexistence between humans and non humans the decay of ecosystems and the systemic devastation of diversity not only in biological but also in cultural and ethnic terms an equally aggressive game in which the outcome might not be in our favor Growing up in Pindamonhangaba a city located in the Para ba Valley in Brazil Pedro Wirz born 1981 in S o Paulo was influenced by the culturally and naturally diverse heritage of his native region The valley which is located between S o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro has been the subject of massive demographic shifts with ongoing economic political and cultural implications Through the observation of these movements and shifts Wirz emphasizes collaborations among and between social worlds by folks with a reverence for laughter and a desire to intuitively explore and materialize the myths and legends of dying cultures and places Wirz lives and works in Z rich Im Lesesaal der Bibliothek baumelt ein fremdartiges Objekt zwischen einem Wespennest und einem Schmetterlingskokon von den Dachbalken des Installationsraums Die dunkle Farbe suggeriert ein reifes Entwicklungsstadium vielleicht sogar einen bevorstehenden Schlupf Die Struktur berl sst es dem Betrachter zu erraten was f r eine Kreatur darin heranwachsen k nnte Ist sie gutartig Der Titel gibt einen Hinweis Die Marimbondo Surr o ist eine Wespenart die im Amazonas Regenwald und in der brasilianischen Region in der der K nstler aufgewachsen ist heimisch ist Sie gilt als sehr aggressiv und gef hrlich Laut Wirz hat die eigent mliche Form des Nestes das dieses Insekt baut die Form der Skulptur beeinflusst Doch die Vorstellung eines sehr gef hrlichen Pi ata Spiels in der Bibliothek wandelt sich rasch von einem surrealistischen Scherz zu einer tieferen Auseinandersetzung Wirz interessiert sich seit langem f r die Formen der Koexistenz zwischen Menschen und Nicht Menschen den Verfall von kosystemen und die systemische Zerst rung der Vielfalt nicht nur in biologischer sondern auch in kultureller und ethnischer Hinsicht Ein ebenso aggressives Spiel das nicht unbedingt zu unseren Gunsten ausfallen wird Pedro Wirz geboren 1981 in S o Paulo wurde von der kulturellen und nat rlichen Vielfalt seiner Heimatregion in Pindamonhangaba einer Stadt im brasilianischen Para ba Tal wo er aufwuchs gepr gt Das Tal das zwischen S o Paulo und Rio de Janeiro liegt war Gegenstand massiver demografischer Verschiebungen mit anhaltenden wirtschaftlichen politischen und kulturellen Auswirkungen In der Beobachtung dieser Bewegungen und Verschiebungen betont Wirz die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Welten Zwischen Menschen f r die zu Lachen das h chste Gut darstellt und kaltherzigem Fortschritt Wirz Anliegen ist es die Mythen und Legenden dieser sterbenden Kulturen und Orte zu erforschen und in Kunstwerken zu materialisieren Wirz lebt und arbeitet in Z rich

Donald Judd has created a small nominal Prints & Multiples on Woodcut in the classic year of 1961.0 During his lifetime Donald Judd 1928 1994 worked with roughly 30 different fabricators to make his art delegating the production to specialized technicians who followed the instructions and sketches he provided with exactness Though some may consider the removal of the artist s hand to be controversial Judd believed it added all the more integrity to his artistic practice Art he insisted should not be representational it should simply exist having a presence through its primacy of color form material and space Judd s responsibility in the creation of his art was cerebral he developed a clear vision for a specific object and then effectively communicated its formal qualities to fabricators who often worked outside of the realm of fine art Judd s preferred printmaking medium was woodcut For this work Untitled 1961 1979 Judd enlisted the help of his father Roy C Judd a woodworking enthusiast for technical assistance Roy C Judd carved the woodblock used for this print according to Judd s instructions and printed the edition of 25 Untitled is one of the earliest examples of Judd s use of the rectangle in a two dimensional work which became his primary printmaking focus in the 1980s With its wide border and horizontal bars of negative space Untitled represents Judd s interest in proportion symmetry and materiality As a monochromatic woodcut Untitled is a key example of his use of cadmium red which the artist once explained seems to be the only color that really makes an object sharp and defines its contours and angles Additional Information Sheet Size 21 x 29 1 4 inchesPrinter Roy C JuddPublisher Edition der Galerie Heiner Friedrich MunichCatalogue Raisonn Schellmann 31Signed dated and numbered in pencil lower margin
Anselm Kiefer has created a large expensive Painting on Emulsion, acrylic, oil, shellac, charcoal, wood and lead on canvas in the classic year of 2018.0 Since the beginning of his career Kiefer has drawn on the legacy and strength of important poets In a process characterised by recurring motifs he reworks and combines literary references often embedding them in symbolically charged landscapes The title of B se Blumen 2018 2021 refers to the famous cycle of poems Les Fleurs du mal by the French poet Charles Baudelaire 1821 1867 Like Baudelaire s poems Anselm Kiefer s works mercilessly examine the very foundations of human existence In a complex web of religious and mythological references a world view is revealed that is shaped by a reciprocal relationship between love and pain despair and hope destruction and renewal In B se Blumen Kiefer captures on canvas this inescapable cycle of life inherent in all forms of existence B se Blumen shows a close up bird s eye view of a patch of earth and exposes its torn dried and deeply furrowed surface Despite the apparent barrenness of the ground flowers sprout from the cracks in the earth their bright heads forming a strong contrast to the dark colours of the dirt 
Emilio Vedova has created a large expensive Painting on Acrylic, pastel, charcoal and sand painting on canvas in the classic year of 1983.0 Emilio Vedova pushed painting into new territories with his visceral and gestural works that engage the viewer and redefine the space they inhabit His expressive strokes and smears of paint convey a raw and violent reaction to the political reality of the post war period The 1980s are widely recognized as the acme of Vedova s career the works of this period are marked by their colourful palette and monumentality In 1980 he travelled to Mexico where the colours and immense landscapes left a lasting impression on him The smears of black yellow and brown in Di Umano 1983 energise the pictorial plane and enhance its emotional force The central contrast between the two non colours black and white is a decisive characteristic of Vedova s uvre This polarisation later often complemented by a further strong colour complies with an inherent wish for clarity of expression and prevents blurring into diverse nuances Moreover the black levels enhance the intensity of the overall effect defining the formal orientation which might otherwise easily be obscured by colour values Carla Schulz Hoffmann 1986 
Erik van Lieshout has created a small nominal Installation on HD video, color, sound with carpet and furniture in the modern year of 2020.0 Erik van Lieshout s contribution to Parcours is one year too late and yet it is astutely topical In 2020 Art Basel was supposed to celebrate its 50 year anniversary To commemorate this van Lieshout chose to go on a cruise and document the trip due to the parallels he saw between a cruise ship and an art fair the promise of wealth and leisure the passengers only task being to walk around and spend money the impersonal structure of a cruise ship resembling the booths and coffee stands of a fair In summer 2019 van Lieshout boarded Holland America Line s New Statendam which houses a huge art collection that had been baptized by Oprah Winfrey and began working The most worthy thing I learned the artist recalls was to make towel animals Soon after the pandemic hit and forced the art fair to cancel all shows including the anniversary Adding insult to injury cruise ships turned out to be major threats for spreading the virus forcing passengers to go into isolation during their already isolated voyage Van Lieshout revisited his film to create Art Blas for Art Basel Parcours finally to be seen in a recreation of an Art Unlimited booth with van Lieshout s signature cutout text on the outside and a carpet to evoke a hint of cruise ship atmosphere Erik van Lieshout born 1968 in Deurne the Netherlands combines found imagery and hand drawn texts and pictures into multimedia installations often adding his own voice In his radically personal style he creates work that is humorous only on the surface His ragtag collages and seemingly haphazard videos address a multitude of contemporary sociopolitical issues Multiculturalism right wing politics issues of minorities outcasts and outsiders as well as the modern consumer society all receive a stern examination through his work Van Lieshout lives and works in Rotterdam Der Beitrag von Erik van Lieshout f r Parcours kommt ein Jahr zu sp t und ist dennoch von gr sstm glicher Aktualit t Anl sslich dem 50 j hrigen Jubil um der Art Basel im Jahr 2020 entschied sich van Lieshout eine Kreuzfahrt zu unternehmen und die Reise zu dokumentieren da er Parallelen zwischen einem Kreuzfahrtschiff und einer Kunstmesse sah das Versprechen von Reichtum und Freizeit verbunden mit der einzigen Aufgabe der Passagiere herumzulaufen und Geld auszugeben dazu hnelt die unpers nliche Struktur eines Kreuzfahrtschiffs den Galerie und Kaffeest nden einer Messe Im Sommer 2019 ging van Lieshout an Bord der New Statendam der Holland America Line die eine grosse von Oprah Winfrey getaufte Kunstsammlung beherbergt und begann zu arbeiten Doch Das Wertvollste was ich gelernt habe erinnert sich der K nstler war Handtuchtiere zu knoten Kurz darauf brach die Pandemie aus und zwang die Kunstmesse alle Ausstellungen abzusagen einschliesslich der Jubil umsausstellung Zu allem berfluss entpuppten sich Kreuzfahrtschiffe als grosse Gefahr f r die Verbreitung des Virus so dass die Passagiere gezwungen waren sich w hrend ihrer ohnehin schon von der Aussenwelt abgeschotteten Fahrt in Isolation zu begeben Van Lieshout kehrte seinem Film zur ck um Art Blas f r Parcours zu kreieren Der entg ltige Film ist schliesslich in einem nachgebauten Stand von Art Unlimited zu sehen mit van Lieshouts charakteristischen collage artigen Texten und einem Spannteppich der einen Hauch von Kreuzfahrtschiff Atmosph re heraufbeschw ren soll Erik van Lieshout geboren 1968 in Deurne Niederlande kombiniert gefundenes Bildmaterial und von Hand gezeichnete Texte und Bilder zu multimedialen Installationen die er oft mit seiner eigenen Stimme unterlegt Durch seinen radikal pers nlichen Stil schafft er Werke die nur an der Oberfl che humorvoll sind Die zusammengew rfelten Collagen und scheinbar zuf lligen Videos thematisieren eine Vielzahl aktueller gesellschaftspolitischer Themen Multikulturalismus rechtsgerichtete Politik der Umgang mit Minderheiten Ausgestossenen und Aussenseitern sowie die moderne Konsumgesellschaft werden in seinem Werk einer strengen Pr fung unterzogen Van Lieshout lebt und arbeitet in Rotterdam

Jack Pierson has created a large expensive Sculpture on Glass, metal, and plastic in the modern year of 2021.0 The American artist Jack Pierson started experimenting with Word Pieces in the early 1990s collecting salvaged letters from street signs which he then assembled as sculptural works In Breaking News 2021 the journalistic phrase conveys a sense of urgency and of urban dynamism The varied sizes colours and styles of the lettering hint at the prior lives these objects have led each containing its own narrative Pierson s Word Pieces can be considered an American variant on concrete poetry in which narrative and language are rendered through the skilful combination of word and material As he explains when I started making the Word Pieces in 1990 I had worked with words I was a graphic designer I was a teenage poet I liked words and I liked letter forms My narrative is one of impulse and editing

Yuli Yamagata has created a small expensive Installation on Mixed media installation in the modern year of 2021.0 Usually dreams are private not directly accessible to anyone but the dreamer In Yuli Yamagata s work for Art Basel Parcours these dreams have escaped and found their way into a bedding shop setting us up for a wild night s sleep Making use of techniques including embroidery upholstery and painting her unique visual language oscillates between sculpture painting and installation The unusual exploration of shapes ranging from anthropomorphism to hybrid creatures and disproportionate objects has led to a practice that is rooted in pop culture and encompasses objects and creatures that verge on the absurd The creatures and objects appear friendly and threatening at the same time Displayed in the space they assume a personality of their own seemingly having secret conversations with the other creatures around them The formal alternations between bulky and slim gigantic and tiny intensify this sentiment The multidisciplinary artist Yuli Yamagata born 1989 in S o Paulo creates joyful often humorous and vividly colorful installations sculptures and painted objects out of sewn and upholstered canvases The theatrical pieces often feature body parts particularly faces legs lips and fingers which call into question concepts of taste consumerism and self image Yamagata blends Surrealist imagery seamlessly with pop culture playing with dimensions and shapes to create dysmorphic sometimes comically absurd objects and creatures that convey a familiar strangeness Or a strange familiarity She lives and works in S o Paulo Gew hnlich sind Tr ume privat und f r niemanden ausser den Tr umenden selbst zug nglich In Yuli Yamagatas Arbeit f r Parcours sind diese Tr ume aber entkommen und haben den Weg in ein Bettwarengesch ft gefunden Klar ist Wir m ssen uns auf eine wilde Nacht gefasst machen Ihre einzigartige Bildsprache f r die sie sich bei Techniken wie Stickerei Polsterei und Malerei bedient bewegt sich zwischen Skulptur Malerei und Installation Die ungew hnlichen Formsprache die anthropomorphe manchmal auch hybride Kreaturen und unproportionierte Objekte hervorbringt gr ndet auf einer Praxis die in der Popkultur verwurzelt ist und mit dem Absurden spielt Die formalen Wechsel zwischen sperrig und biegsam zwischen gigantisch und winzig verst rken dieses Gef hl noch Die Kreationen wirken freundlich und bedrohlich zugleich im Raum nehmen sie eine eigene Pers nlichkeit an und es wirkt als w rden sie geheime Gespr che untereinander f hren Die multidisziplin re K nstlerin Yuli Yamagata geboren 1989 in S o Paulo schafft fr hliche oft humorvolle und farbenfrohe Installationen Skulpturen und bemalte Objekte aus gen hten und gepolsterten Leinw nden Die theatralischen Arbeiten zeigen oft menschliche K rperteile insbesondere Gesichter Beine Lippen und Finger die Konzepte von Geschmack Konsum und Selbstbild thematisieren Yamagata mischt surrealistische Bilder nahtlos mit Popkultur und spielt mit Dimensionen und Formen um dysmorphe manchmal komisch absurde Objekte und Kreaturen zu schaffen die eine vertraute Fremdheit vermitteln Oder eine seltsame Vertrautheit Sie lebt und arbeitet in S o Paulo 
Glenn Ligon has created a large expensive Painting on Etching ink and acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2020.0 Glenn Ligon s large scale Debris Field Red 18 2020 2021 continues his career long investigation into the interplay between abstraction and figuration which underpins the conceptual and formal concerns of his practice Departing from his earlier text based works which borrowed from James Baldwin Ralph Ellison Gertrude Stein and Jean Genet Ligon s Debris Field series focuses on letterforms based on his own etchings and stencil drawings rather than literary passages Ligon renders Debris Field Red 18 through overlapping silk screening and hand stenciling continuing his practice of addition and repetition as a means to alter abstract and obscure legibility The letter based shapes that punctuate the work s surface present a complex articulation of meaning eschewing direct reading Here letters are upturned inverted smudged scraped and overpainted interrupted by gaps and streaks and set in relief or seemingly dissolved against a cadmium red ground The forms that traverse the work s textural plane produce an abstract topology dissolving any sense of orderly language In addition to the textural ruptures and fleeting legibility of Debris Field Red 18 Ligon brings the resonance of color to the fore Relating this work to the stylistic permutations of Andy Warhol s Death and Disaster series 1963 and the gripping cover design of Elijah Muhammad s The Fall of America 1973 Ligon stated I remember visiting a red car crash painting at MoMA when I was in my 20s I was deeply influenced by it interested in the repetition interested in the subject matter But one can t be Warhol Nor would I want to be So I ve been trying to figure out a way to grapple with that and one of the ways to do so is to nod to it with this red color But I was also looking at other things Elijah Muhammad s The Fall of America was on the bookshelf in my family home The image on its cover is an outline of America basically a bright red cover with dripping letters that spell out the title of the book You stare at things for years letting them seep in and then try to find a way to use them 1 Drawing from these two sources Ligon s Debris Field Red 18 articulates a devastation of expression amid ongoing conditions of systemic inequities while simultaneously allowing for the possibility of transformation As Helen Molesworth contends A debris field is any location or site that contains the wreckage of what was once a whole object For Ligon the debris field is the fate of language under the pressures of unresolved and conventionally unspoken racism which undergirds the American project These debris fields of language politely perform the profundity of not being able to make sense of the senseless 2 1 Helen Molesworth Glenn Ligon Untitled America Debris Field Synecdoche Notes for a Poem on the Third World Los Angeles Regen Projects 2019 p 49 2 Glenn Ligon quoted in Conversation Glenn Ligon and Hamza Walker in Glenn Ligon Untitled America Debris Field Synecdoche Notes for a Poem on the Third World Los Angeles Regen Projects 2019 p 75

Bunny Rogers has created a large cheap Sculpture on Patinated bronze in the modern year of 2021.0 In a new series of works created for Art Basel Parcours Rogers is installing a towering bronze sculpture that bears a striking resemblance to the stone gargoyles perched on various churches around Basel and the basilisks that sit atop the city s public fountains On closer inspection we see that it is not old but modern not solemn but whimsical even cartoonish It reminds us more of an enlarged bronze cast Pok mon figurine than a medieval mythical creature In fact Rogers work draws from an early highly formative online experience the Neopets universe which still exists on various online gaming platforms today after more than two decades For the artist like many others this was an intimate fascinating encounter Rogers who was 9 at the time recalls My Neopets were real to me In this installation she transposes the characters from the online social space into the urban fabric of Basel and in the form of large bronze statues Neopia transcends the boundaries of the virtual world to finally manifest itself in the social and material reality of an art fair Inspired by this beloved virtual animal kingdom from her childhood Rogers Neopet sculpture is a memorial to a highly subjective inner world And by situating it in the public sphere she invites us to tap into this intimate space of memory fantasy and identity The multifaceted practice of American artist Bunny Rogers born 1990 in Houston Texas draws upon a highly personal constellation of television shows movies Internet forums and everyday objects to reflect upon experiences of loss alienation intimacy and community From exploring AOL Kids art forums which she has said were deeply impactful and inspiring and making her first drawings in Microsoft Paint it was only a natural progression for Rogers to mine the opportunities to be found in LiveJournal Neopets and Second Life Out of online artifacts and references she creates immersive and highly personal yet mesmerizing worlds governed by their own internal logic Along with her focus on digital media she often uses poetry most notably in her Tumblr blog Cunny as a form of expression Rogers lives and works in New York Eigens f r den Art Basel Parcours geschaffen errichtet Rogers eine kolossale Bronzeskulptur die eine gewisse hnlichkeit mit den steinernen Wasserspeiern auf verschiedenen Kirchen in Basel oder den Basilisken auf den ffentlichen Brunnen der Stadt aufweist Bei n herer Betrachtung f llt jedoch auf dass das Objekt nicht alt sondern modern ist skurril fast karikaturhaft und erinnert eher an eine vergr sserte in Bronze gegossene Pok mon Figur als an mittelalterliche Fabelwesen Tats chlich gr ndet das Werk auf einer fr hen stark pr genden Online Erfahrung Rogers dem Neopets Universum das auch heute noch nach mehr als zwei Jahrzehnten auf verschiedenen Online Spielplattformen existiert F r die K nstlerin war dies wie f r viele andere eine faszinierende wie auch intime Begegnung Rogers damals neun Jahre alt erinnert sich Meine Neopets waren f r mich real In dieser Installation bertr gt sie die Charaktere aus dem sozialen Online Raum in das urbane Gef ge von Basel und in Form von einer grossen Bronzestatue berschreitet Neopia die Grenze von der virtuellen Welt in die Wirklichkeit um sich schliesslich in der sozialen und materiellen Realit t einer Kunstmesse zu manifestieren Inspiriert von der geliebten virtuellen Tierwelt ihrer Kindheit ist Rogers Neopet Skulptur das Denkmal f r ein hochgradig subjektives inneres Universum Im ffentlichen Raum platziert l dt die Figur uns ein Rogers intime Sph re der Erinnerung Fantasie und Identit t zu betreten Die vielschichtige Praxis der amerikanischen K nstlerin Bunny Rogers geboren 1990 in Houston Texas st tzt sich auf eine sehr pers nliche Konstellation von Fernsehsendungen Filmen Internetforen und Alltagsgegenst nden um ber Erfahrungen von Verlust Entfremdung Intimit t und Gemeinschaft zu reflektieren Nach den Kunstforen von AOL Kids die sie nach eigener Aussage zutiefst beeindruckt und inspiriert haben begann Rogers ihre ersten Zeichnungen in Microsoft Paint anzufertigen und die M glichkeiten von LiveJournal Neopets und Second Life zu erkunden Aus Online Artefakten und Referenzen erschafft sie eindringliche und sehr pers nliche aber dennoch faszinierende Welten die einer eigenen inneren Logik folgen Neben ihrem Fokus auf digitale Medien benutzt sie poetische Texte als weitere Ausdrucksform vor allem in ihrem Tumblr Blog Cunny Rogers lebt und arbeitet in New York

Clare Woods has created a medium nominal Painting on Oil on aluminium in the modern year of 2020.0 This work by Clare Woods was painted in the build up to and during the first lock down in an intense and isolated period which allowed Woods to occupy a position where she could compare the past and the idea of the future closely as the present was so unrecognisable and uncomfortable I found it so hard to describe what I was feeling and the only way it could be translated into something real was through painting it I was trying to capture those moments in the home and the focus shift for outside to inside where everything familiar felt unfamiliar and where the detail in the everyday became heightened re seeing the ordinary in a different way I felt as though I was occupying a position on both sides of a boundary of a very transformative space All of Clare Woods paintings are based on photographs sometimes her own sometimes found imagery The cropping and editing of the original photograph through drawing removes some of the form so that they begin to sit on the edge of legibility and figuration Woods conceptually empties the source image but then replaces a new interpretation during the act of painting This physical break down of the image allows a slowing down and falling apart of the visual partly forcing the viewer to question their ability to decipher the content of what is in front of them and partly questioning what it means to live in a time of mass image consumption and in a world that treats banality and disaster in the same way 
Georg Baselitz has created a large expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the modern year of 2019.0 Georg Baselitz b 1938 Saxony has had a profound influence on international art since 1960 and is indisputably one of the most important artists of our time He shaped a new identity for German art in the second half of the twentieth century in reaction to the trauma and tragedy of the Second World War he developed an artistic vocabulary which draws on the work of his forebears whilst remaining unique and wholly individualistic Since then Baselitz has constantly renewed his practice through formal developments drawing upon art history and his own extensive oeuvre never allowing himself to become restricted by a single identifiable style Eisprinzessin 2019 forms part of a recent series of paintings that mark a significant development in Baselitz s technique created using a transfer method The artist paints the composition onto a piece of unstretched canvas which is then pressed against a second canvas while wet creating a mirror image impression in the final work This process recalls Andy Warhol s blotted line technique from the 1950s combining ink drawing with basic printmaking that allowed him to create a variety of illustrations on a similar theme which Baselitz has here translated into the medium of oil paint on canvas His technique also leaves visible artefacts such as the blurring of the figure s face or the aerated texture of the black paint which contribute to the gestural expressivity of the work Eisprinzessin and other works from this series reveal the influence of Abstract Expressionist Willem de Kooning and in particular his seminal painting Woman I 1950 52 The Museum of Modern Art New York which Baselitz encountered in the 1958 travelling exhibition New American Painting while still a student at the Hochschule f r Bildende K nste in Berlin The reverberations of this artistic encounter can still be felt in Baselitz s work sixty years later both in his choice of subject and his expressive gestural style These new works also contain a reference to another of Baselitz s predecessors with the lightness boldness and vivid colouration conceived as an homage to Roy Lichtenstein The figure in Eisprinzessin can be identified as the artist s wife Elke who has been a constant presence in his imagery since the first upside down portrait he painted of her in 1969 The Elke paintings constitute the largest single group of Baselitz s portraits in which the artist engages in the struggle of representation the inescapability of subjectivity and the representation of the self through a significant other As art historian Michael Auping writes Throughout the centuries the practice of portraiture has in the end represented the merging of two identities that of the artist and his subject Eisprinzessin is based on a Polaroid image from the mid 1970s in which Elke is shown sitting on a chair with her arms folded and legs crossed at the ankles This particular configuration is one to which the artist has returned repeatedly throughout his career inspiring a remarkable range of works in various media Over the years the pictorial field surrounding Elke has become increasingly abstract as Baselitz finds new ways in which to approach established subjects In this recent portrait the female figure is almost subsumed by the vigour of the mark making with traces of the artist s hand evident in the energetic gestural strokes and drips of paint Oscillating between figuration and abstraction the composition is formally structured by areas of distinct non naturalistic colour while the innovative technique draws attention to the materiality of the painted surface

Jules de Balincourt has created a medium expensive Painting on oil on panel in the modern year of 2021.0 Internationally renowned French American artist Jules de Balincourt is known for colorful radiant paintings which meditate on the world s increasingly globalized social political and cultural dynamics Shifting from a broader sociological view of borders territories and nation states the artist s recent psychological landscapes bring us closer to humanity s complex relationships with natural and urban settings Capturing our world through a dreamlike lens de Balincourt s recognizable palette emphasizes organic beauty Deft coloration is present in They come to get lost 2021 which portrays a Costa Rican landscape the artist completed from memory The kaleidoscopic moonlit setting is constructed with a series of variegated forms Weathering the formation of the valley populated by several groups of people on either side and layered escarpment in the foreground waves of saturated tones create fluidity within the canvas This singular paint application imbues an expansive quality the environment is boundless within its constructed and perceived reality On the nature of his practice the artist notes I like the idea of placing the viewer at these crossroads of painting in which one s emotive response hovers between rational realism or figuration on the one hand and the abstract subconscious on the other 
Sam Gilliam has created a large expensive Installation on acrylic on Cerex nylon in the classic year of 2018.0 American abstract artist Sam Gilliam is best known for his canonical Drape series which expanded upon the tenets of Abstract Expressionism through the artist s groundbreaking experimentation with color material and space Consisting of unstretched canvases draped from the ceiling walls or over objects such as sawhorses these paintings range from small sheets to large heavy canvases that require being bolted in place In Untitled 2018 parallel cloths fall in waves from the ceiling and gather in complex layers folding over each other to create a sculptural form dictated by gravity The painted surfaces result from several methods of application including soaking folding and spattering practices Gilliam has implemented since the mid 1960s One cloth contains swaths of warm colors canary yellows rosy pinks and oranges the other is soaked with cooler hues of purple dark blue pinks and yellows Drips and splatters dot both fabrics in addition to the patterns which emerge from the artist s emblematic staining and folding techniques Together these paintings appear to rise from the ground and invite viewers to view the painting as an immersive experience

Vittorio Brodmann has created a medium cheap Painting on Oil and pencil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Vittorio Brodmann s work touches on a number of painting traditions as well modern cartoons His compositions and themes disclose references in equal measure from the surreal automatism of Andr Masson and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner s intense colour palette to traditional Japanese Yokai prints renderings of phantom like entities often with no distinct shape Sitcom set ups and one liners can be seen to inform Brodmann in tandem with the aesthetics of early Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network animations Figures slip into undefinable shapes and forms assuming both comical and misshapen proportions Features exaggerated noses are elongated and butts protrude all up against landscapes and backgrounds whose tones recall popular cartoons As animated figures and doodles collapse and mutate into each other across the canvas Brodmann marries deliberate approach with coincidence the scenarios hold defined narratives but ultimately remain open Brodmann continuously entertains this balance most notably in situating the works in between the slapstick and earnest 
Michaël Borremans has created a small nominal Work on Paper on pencil and white ink on paper in the classic year of 2004.0 The films paintings and drawings by Belgian artist Micha l Borremans overwhelm the viewer through the use of deceleration precision and vortex His seductive works contain timeless images of inner drive and external force of the latent pressure involved in being human Behind a veil of stylistic perfection the artist simulates common rituals of interpretation and meaning His intensely atmospheric images are puzzles involving political and psychological patterns of perceiving the world which oscillate in a camouflaging fragile way between inexorable realism and nebulous distance

Robert Mapplethorpe has created a small cheap Photography on silver gelatin print in the classic year of 1982.0 Robert Mapplethorpe New York 4 Nov 1946 Boston 9 Mar 1989 the extraordinary controversial proponent of the American avant garde remains an anti conformist symbol of a timeless form of the contemporary He managed to embody an extreme sense of freedom and this consistently emerges in the interactions between his artistic practice the private and intimate aspects of his personal life his circle of friends celebrity and the public There is always something new to be discovered working through the immensely rich patrimony of perspectives and points of view that the artist has left us through his body of work which continues to surprise us through changes of taste and time always keeping a formidable balance between the current and the timeless An extraordinary grace is found in unpredictable layers in aspects of life that can only be revealed by crossing boundaries flirting with pleasure and delight as much as with the unconventional while shedding a light on the appearance of things that never hides the darker side Running through the pictures of Mapplethorpe s whole career one can build a sequence of associations find contrasts and similarities in the compositional schemes and genres dear to him portraiture still life male and female nudes body parts and sensuality It s a journey that spans from the diamond pure freshness of the eye of youth in the 70 s its gushing curiosity fed by the hunger for discovery and the new to the more layered and sophisticated moments of the 80 s tinged with a bit of hedonism and skillful refinement The fascination and necessity of dialogue between his deep passion for and knowledge of classical sculpture and painting constantly unfolds an extremely formal and stylistic precision is the ground on which lays his capacity for letting his eccentricity appear his ability to capture the unexpected thereby creating a sense of mysterious awe In all of the pictures moments are captured with a magical feeling of weight and movement the constraint of postures and tension in the bodies and still life all reveal the evident wish of capturing humans and inanimate objects with the same intention The revelation of an inner truth through the sensational vision of Mapplethorpe s eye and of its prosthetic camera tool leads to a masterly modulation of stark black and white tones diving and melting into a field of softer and ever changing shades of greys

Fred Lonidier has created a medium nominal Photography on Vintage original board with tipped-in photographs and video in the classic year of 1976.0 Documentary and Corporate Violence Allan Sekula A small group of contemporary artists are working on an art that deals with the social ordering of people s lives Most of their work involves still photography and video most relies heavily on written or spoken language I m talking about a representational art an art that refers to something beyond itself Form and mannerism are not ends in themselves These works might be about any number of things ranging from the material and ideological space of the self to the dominant social realities of corporate spectacle and corporate power The initial questions are these How do we invent our lives out of a limited range of possibilities and how are our lives invented for us by those in power If these questions are asked only within the institutional boundaries of elite culture only with the art world then the answers will be merely academic Given a certain poverty of means this art aims toward a wider audience and toward considerations of concrete social transformation We might be tempted to think of this work as a variety of documentary That s all right as long as we expose the myth that accompanies the label the folklore of photographic truth The rhetorical strength of documentary is imagined to reside in the unequivocal character of the camera s evidence in an essential realism I shouldn t have to point out that photographic meaning is indeterminate the same picture can convey a variety of messages under differing presentational circumstances Consider the evidence offered by bank holdup cameras Taken automatically these pictures could be said to be unpolluted by sensibility an extreme form of documentary If the surveillance engineers who developed these cameras have an esthetic it s one of raw technological instrumentality Just the facts ma am But a courtroom is a battleground of fictions What is it that a photograph points to A young white woman holds a submachine gun The gun is handled confidently aggressively The gun is almost dropped out of fear A fugitive heiress A kidnap victim An urban guerrilla A willing participant A case of brainwashing A case of rebellion A case of schizophrenia The outcome based on the true reading of the evidence is a function less of objectivity than of politics maneuvering Reproduced in the mass media this picture might attest to the omniscience of the state within a glamorized and mystifying spectacle of revolution and counterrevolution But any police photography that is publicly displayed is both a specific attempt at identification and a reminder of police power over criminal elements The only objective truth that photographs offer is the assertion that somebody or something in this case an automated camera was somewhere and took a picture Everything else is up for grabs Someone once wrote of the French photographer Eugene Atget that he depicted the streets of Paris as though they were scenes of crime That remark serves to poeticize a rather deadpan nonexpressionist style to celebrate the photographer in his role as detective searching for clues Documentary photograph has amassed mountains of evidence In this pictorial presentation of fact the genre has contributed much to spectacle to retinal excitation to voyeurism and only a little to the critical understanding of the social world A truly critical social documentary will frame the crime the trial and the system of justice and its official myths Artists working toward this end may or may not produce images that are theatrical and overtly contrived they may or may not present texts that read like fiction Social truth is something other than a matter of convincing style A political critique of the documentary genre is sorely needed Socially conscious artists have much to learn from both the successes and the mistakes compromises and collaborations of their Progressive Era and New Deal predecessors How do we assess the close historical partnership of documentary artists and social democrats The cooptation of the documentary style by corporate capitalism notable the oil companies and the television networks in the late 1940 s How do we disentangle ourselves from the authoritarian and bureaucratic aspects of the genre from its implicit positivism All of this is evidenced by any one second of an Edward R Murrow or Walter Cronkite telecast How do we produce an art that elicits dialogue rather than uncritical pseudo political affirmation Looking backward at the art world hubbub about photograph as a fine art we find a near pathological avoidance of any such questioning A curious thing happens when documentary is officially recognized as art Suddenly the audience s attention is directed toward mannerism toward sensibility toward the physical and emotional risks taken by the artist Documentary is thought to be art when it transcends its reference to the world when the work can be regarded first and foremost as an act of self expression on the part of the artist A cult of authorship an auteurism takes hold of the image separating it from the social conditions of its making and elevating it above the multitude of lowly and mundane uses to which photography is commonly put The culture journalists myth of Diane Arbus is interesting in this regard Most readings of her work careen along an axis between opposing poles of realism and expressionism On the one hand her portraits are seen as transparent vehicles for the social or psychological truth of her subjects Arbus elicits meaning from their persons At the other extreme is projection The work is thought to express her tragic vision a vision confirmed by her suicide each image is nothing so much as a contribution to the artist s self portrait These readings coexist they enhance one another despite their mutual contradiction I think that a good deal of the generalized esthetic appeal of Arbus work along with that of most art photography has to do with this indeterminacy of reading this sense of being cast adrift between profound social insight and refined solipsism At the heart of this fetishistic cultivation and promotion of the artist s humanity is a certain disdain for the ordinary humanity of those who have been photographed They become the other exotic creatures objects of contemplation Perhaps this wouldn t be so suspect if it weren t for the tendency of professional documentary photographers to aim their cameras downward toward those with little power or prestige The obverse is the cult of celebrity the organized production of envy in a mass audience The most intimate human scale relationship to suffer mystification in all this is the specific social engagement that results in the image the negotiation between photographer and subject in the making of a portrait the seduction coercion collaboration or rip off But if we widen the angle of our view we find that the broader institutional politics of elite and popular culture are also being obscured in the romance of the photographer as artist Fred Lonidier is one of a small number of photographers who set out deliberately to work against the strategies that have succeeded in making photography a high art Their work begins with the recognition that photography is operative at every level of our culture That is they insist on treating photographs not as privileged objects but as common cultural artifacts The solitary sparely captioned photograph on the gallery wall is a sign above all of an aspiration toward the esthetic and market conditions of modernist painting and sculpture In this white void meaning is thought to emerge entirely from within the artwork The importance of the framing discourse is masked context is hidden Lonidier on the other hand openly brackets his photographs with language using texts to anchor contradict reinforce subvert complement particularize or go beyond the meanings offered by the images themselves These pictures are located with a narrative structure I m not talking about photo essays a clich ridden form that is the noncommercial counterpart to the photographic advertisement Photo essays are an outcome of a mass circulation picture magazine esthetic the esthetic of the merchandisable column inch and rapid excited reading Fred Lonidier s Health and Safety Game is about the handling of industrial injury and disease by corporate capitalism pointing to the systemic character of everyday violence in the workplace Some statistics one in four American workers is exposed on a daily basis to death injury and disease causing work conditions According to a Nader report job casualties are statistically at least three times more serious than street crime So much for T V cop shows An observation anyone who has ever lived or worked in an industrial working class community can probably attest to the commonness of disfigurement among people on the job and in the street I can recall going to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry and visiting the coalmine there Hoarse voiced men retired miners led the tourists through a programmed demonstration of mining technology When the time came to deal with safety one off the guides set off a controlled little methane expulsion No one mentioned black lung disease in this corporate artwork although the evidence rasped from the throats of the guides Lonidier s evidence consists of twenty or so case studies of individual workers each displayed on large panels laid out in a rather photojournalistic fashion The reference to photojournalism is deliberate I think because the work refuses to deliver any of the emphatic goodies that we are accustomed to in photo essays Conventional human interest is absent Lonidier is aware of the ease with which liberal documentary artists have converted violence and suffering into esthetic objects For all his good intentions for example Eugene Smith in Minamata provided more a presentation of his compassion for mercury poisoned Japanese fisherfolk than one of their struggle for retribution against the corporate polluter I ll say it again the subjective aspect of liberal esthetics is compassion rather than collective struggle Pity mediated by an appreciation of great art supplants political understanding It has been remarked that Eugene Smith s portrait of a Minamata mother bathing her retarded and deformed daughter is a deliberate reference to the Pieta Unlike Smith Lonidier takes the same photographs that a doctor might When the evidence is hidden within the body Lonidier borrows and copies x ray films These pictures have a brutal clinical effect Each worker s story is reduced to a rather schematic account of injury disease hospitalization and endless bureaucratic run around by companies trying to shirk responsibility and liability All too frequently we find that the end of the story the worker is left unemployed and undercompensated At the same time though these people are fighting A machinist with lung cancer tells of stealing samples of dust from the job placing them on the kitchen griddle in a home made experiment to detect asbestos a material that his bosses had denied using The anonymity of Lonidier s subjects is a precaution against retaliation against them many are still fighting court cases Lonidier s presentation is an analog of sorts for the way in which corporate bureaucrats handle the problems of industrial safety yet he subverts the model by telling the story from below from the place occupied by the worker in the hierarchy The case study form is a model of authoritarian handling of human lives The layout of the panels reflects the distribution of power Quotes from the workers are set in type so small that they are nearly unreadable The titles are set in large type Machinist s Lung Egg Packer s Arm The body and the life are presented as they have been fragmented by management Injury is a loss of labor power a negative commodity overhead Injury is not a diminishing of human life but a statistical impingement on the corporate profit margin The danger exists here as in other works of socially conscious art of being overcome by the very oppressive forms and conditions one is critiquing of being devoured by the enormous machinery of material and symbolic objectification Political irony walks a thin line between resistance and surrender Nevertheless Lonidier s work documents monopoly capitalism s inability to deliver the conditions of a full human life One realizes that the health and safety issue goes beyond the struggle for compensation enforcement of safety standards and improved working conditions Against violence of this scale violence directed at the human body at the environment and at working people s ability to control their own lives we need to counterpose an active resistance to monopoly capitalism s increasing power and arrogance Copyrighted 1976 Allan Sekula Versions of THE HEALTH AND SAFETY GAME have previously been exhibited at Long

Manfred Kuttner has created a medium expensive Painting on tempera, fluorescent painton canvas, wood in the classic year of 1963.0 Manfred Kuttner 1937 2007 is considered as one of the pioneers of German Pop Art and Capitalist Realism For his paintings he used novel Plaka colors in fluorescent neon tones which until then had been used exclusively in advertising In his works there are references to Op Art Zero and Minimal as well as to Pop Art and Nouveau Realisme Nevertheless the work defies precise formal classification and thus occupies a special position in the art of the 1960s In 1963 Manfred Kuttner organized the Demonstrative Exhibition together with Konrad Lueg Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter In the same year he received first prize for his contribution to the San Marino Biennale together with the artist group ZERO Manfred Kuttner retired from the art world as early as the mid 1960s In 2013 the Villa Merkel in Esslingen and the Langen Foundation in Neuss dedicated comprehensive retrospectives to Kuttner s work 
Theaster Gates has created a medium expensive Sculpture on Clay and manganese-based glaze, custom-made plinth in the modern year of 2021.0 The work of Theaster Gates is deeply engaged in material and cultural preservation especially as it relates to historical and contemporary power dynamics From reactivating archives such as those of the magazines Jet and Ebony to recovering and repurposing buildings on Chicago s South Side Gates s expansive practice also includes work in ceramics painting sculpture installation music and performance Drawing from diverse sources and narratives he produces work that invokes the preservation and thoughtful examination of oft neglected or distorted Black cultural and social histories Ceramics have always been central to Gates s practice and his development as an artist a fact further emphasized by his fabricated artist origin story in which as he put it he created a story centered on a fictive pottery commune in Mississippi founded in the 1960s by an also fictive Japanese ceramicist Yamaguchi who had fled Hiroshima married a black civil rights activist and instituted a ritual called Plate Convergences or conversations where people came from all over to discuss issues of race political difference and inequity Yamaguchi is supposed to have made ceramic plates specifically for the black food served at the dinners and this dinnerware went into the Yamaguchi Institute Collection as part of the story I claimed him as a mentor I made ceramic plates videotaped highly curated dinners and found a space for an exhibition of the ceramics and video We gave a huge Japanese soul food dinner made by a Japanese chef and my sister in honor of the Yamaguchis and their dinners 1Many of the ideas present in this fabled origin story still resonate in Gates s ceramics practice today Whether throwing a vase tea bowl or simple cup Gates s vessels exist somewhere at the intersection of the functional symbolic ritual and spiritual Generative objects of profound significance they invite viewers to gather engage and reflect His vessels are also decidedly aesthetic drawing equal influence from Shoji Hamada the master potter and leading figure of the Japanese folk craft movement Mingei and David Drake also known as Dave the Potter who despite being enslaved in antebellum South Carolina made stoneware pottery adorned with poetic couplets and his signature In an analysis of Gates s artistic heritage and what the artist later termed his Afro Mingei aesthetic Lisa Yun Lee commented The powerful mash up and convergence of African American culture with Japanese minimalism have inextricably and poetically woven themselves into Gates style 2 Such cross cultural aesthetic and philosophical convergence is clearly visible in Golden Orb with Ring with the simple yet elegant shape of the vessel not so dissimilar from the bulbous shapes of Drake s jugs giving the natural textures and sheen of the fired clay and glaze as well as the patterns in the grain of the custom made wood plinth equal prominence The present work also employs a highly reactive manganese based glaze which features repeatedly in the abstract but always functional ceramics of another of Gates s role models British ceramicist Hans Coper In discussing his most recent ceramics Gates noted My hope was to strip the material back to its most basic form then call forth the potency of ritual utility and philosophy and end up at new bodies of work and new ways of thinking about other forms The artist continued More than anything I want to be moved by forms and invest deeply in older ways of making and the forms that ensue I want to recall the truths within forms eat from them The bowl jar teapot vase and cup offer me a form of lexicon that allows the bust head ceremonial offering and modes of abstraction to flow more easily I have forms to push against and to agree with and venerate Like his predecessors in Golden Orb with Ring Gates turns to and elevates the alchemical craft of ceramics as a source of great aesthetic social and philosophical potential 1 Gates quoted in Lilly Wei Theaster Gates in Art in America December 5 2011 https www artinamericamagazine com news features magazines theaster gates 2 Lisa Yun Lee Survey Everything and the Burden is Beautiful in Theaster Gates New York Phaidon Press Limited 2015 p 88 
Katharina Grosse has created a large expensive Painting on acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Katharina Grosse 1961 lives and works in Berlin In her work Katharina Grosse consistently questions the medium of painting and explores its limits Her abstract paintings often consist of bright colors that she applies to the canvas in horizontal or vertical structures Grosse works mainly with a spray gun with which she applies the paint directly Thus the individual layers of paint overlap or run into each other She often goes beyond the canvas and includes the surrounding space furniture objects and even the outdoor space Katharina Grosse has had solo exhibitions in numerous important institutions including Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin 2020 The Baltimore Museum of Art 2020 K11 Art Foundation Shaghai China 2019 National Gallery Prague 2019 MoMA PS1 New York City USA 2016 Garage Museum of Contemporary Art Moscow Russia 2015 Museum Kunstpalast D sseldorf 2014 Nasher Sculpture Center Dallas USA 2013 Kunstmuseum Bonn 2011 MassMoCA North Adams USA 2010 or the UCLA Hammer Museum Los Angeles USA 2001

Vittorio Brodmann has created a medium cheap Painting on Oil and gouache on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Vittorio Brodmann s work touches on a number of painting traditions as well modern cartoons His compositions and themes disclose references in equal measure from the surreal automatism of Andr Masson and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner s intense colour palette to traditional Japanese Yokai prints renderings of phantom like entities often with no distinct shape Sitcom set ups and one liners can be seen to inform Brodmann in tandem with the aesthetics of early Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network animations Figures slip into undefinable shapes and forms assuming both comical and misshapen proportions Features exaggerated noses are elongated and butts protrude all up against landscapes and backgrounds whose tones recall popular cartoons As animated figures and doodles collapse and mutate into each other across the canvas Brodmann marries deliberate approach with coincidence the scenarios hold defined narratives but ultimately remain open Brodmann continuously entertains this balance most notably in situating the works in between the slapstick and earnest 
Mira Schor has created a small cheap Painting on Oil on linen in the classic year of 1993.0 The semi colon in this work and others functions as a destabilizing pause It is an asymmetrical form visually dynamic and operating both as a bridge and divide between two segments of a sentence It does not denote an ending but a continuation Schor uses the semi colon to signify a clitoris and female pleasure to highlight that language is inscribed in the most intimate parts of experience and the body Historically patriarchy has used language to control and denigrate that experience e g hysteria but Schor and other feminists have created language that can liberate it Schor insists that women are filled with language that is not only determined by patriarchy but which speaks out speaks back which has philosophy The battle over the language of the body and pleasure continues for women and LGBTQ communities

Lara Favaretto has created a medium nominal Painting on found painting, wool in the modern year of 2020.0 A painting on canvas is entirely covered with a orange woollen thread which both protects and hides it leaving just a vague glimpse of the drawing beneath This work is one of a series the artist started in 2010 all of which follow the same process paintings found or bought on the Internet at a flea market or from an antique dealer are entrusted to a wool worker who has devised a special technique for wrapping the entire surface of the canvas uniformly using a single thread pulled absolutely taut Applied vertically and tied to the back of the frame the thread forms a dense warp which veils the painting beneath while also making it more captivating The colour of the wool which is chosen to match the tones of the painting conceals or by contrast reveals the subject underneath it which might be a landscape or a still life a genre scene or a portrait a mythological scene or a purely geometrical abstraction In most cases the paintings are single but there have also been diptychs and triptychs The title of the work is that of the colour number of the wool used based on the Pantone chart with the sole exceptions of black and white which always appear as such The range of Pantone colours also establishes the maximum potential number of works in the series Through this operation the canvases which are made by generally unknown amateurs are saved from oblivion only to be returned to anonymity hidden beneath their unusual lining The wool which is chosen from warehouse remainders or from factories when it goes out of production is thus salvaged by the artist who while giving up total control of the work also promotes the principle of sustainability and disposal of an existing product This process augments the vulnerability of the works which is already implicit in the use of wool a material that is delicate and that deteriorates easily The condition imposed by the peculiar process of creation which involves the use of materials that are out of production means that the thread cannot be replaced if it breaks for the same type of wool is no longer available and the use of a different colour would contradict the title of the work which is that of the Pantone number This limitation accentuates the contrast between showing and concealing that is already inherent in the work depending on the angle it is observed from it may appear as a monochrome surface or as a complex pictorial composition preventing any complete rewarding view of it The thread must be extremely taut in order to ensure this essential effect but the strain it is subjected to means there is a risk that as time goes by it might break revealing the painting beneath which would thus be stripped of the enigmatic power it is given by the woollen filter The possibility of irremediable damage being caused is an inherent part of the work and it creates a sense of tension and expectation in the viewers as well as the realisation that they are observing a process that is still under way The complete removal of the broken thread marks a point of no return and the start of the final phase of the work which is that of revealing the painting making it appear in its own brazen ingenuousness and ironically bringing into question both its own legitimacy in view of its new look and its real auteurship 
Anthony Caro has created a large expensive Sculpture on Steel, rusted and varnished in the classic year of 1980.0 Anthony Caro was born in 1924 in New Malden England and died in 2013 Considered to be one of the greatest sculptors of the last fifty years Sir Anthony Caro took the norms and even the definitions of sculpture in new directions He experimented with a wide range of different materials such as sculptures made from welded or assembled metal parts painted metal constructions and bronze table top pieces His work is rooted in a radical exploration of space

Lucy Otter has created a small cheap Painting on oil on linen in the classic year of 1968.0 THE PAINTERS PAINT From the 60s through the late 70s Lucy Otter has produced a number of artworks conceived to be exhibited in unconventional form abstract paintings deliberately devoid of any narrative aspects hung or installed in generic public places rather than the more specific ones of an art gallery or Museum The works here presented bearing no title but generically defined as Paintings for Furniture were appropriately exhibited in the Fall of 1969 in the context of a furniture shop Otter radically installed her paintings over any kind of piece of furniture wardrobes cabinets tables chairs and even doors worked as exhibition surface deliberately avoiding the use of any available wall The artist s work features also other forms of expression as sculptures drawings and experimental films where a conceptual approach mingles with a more personal kind of themes Some works may appear to be formal exercises on her personal account on the meaning of life Otter tirelessly plays with the concept of abstraction per se as well as keeping on pushing the boundaries of the exhibition of her work The title for this presentation comes from a short film realized in 1968 T P P most likely standing for the sentence The Painters Paint The moving images show the hand of the artist peculiarly writing her own name wishing to convey the idea that value often varies over time as well as the artist s signature does Perhaps an eloquent strategy to reclaim her identity and fill in the absence of signature in her work Eliot Barber Lucy Otter 1937 Three Corners Alaska lives and works in Pepys Cornwall Before choosing abstraction and conceptual language for her artistic work Otter studied at the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated herself to the practice of classic garden design In parallel to this activity from 1958 to 1964 she was part of the group MAP She was guest professor at Le cole Nationale Sup rioure des Beaux Arts in Paris during 1979 to 1983 Her work has been shown internationally and was exhibited for the first time at the Paris Petit Salon des Artistes in 1959 Lucy Otter is a character from the novel Siete Cavernas by Gabriel Sierra which has not been published yet 
Daniel Arsham has created a medium expensive Painting on Acrylic on canvas panel in the modern year of 2021.0 Daniel Arsham s uchronic aesthetics revolves around his concept of fictional archaeology Working in sculpture architecture drawing and film he creates and crystallizes ambiguous in between spaces or situations and further stages what he refers to as future relics of the present They are eroded casts of modern artifacts and contemporary human figures which he expertly makes out of some geological material such as sand selenite or volcanic ash for them to appear as if they had just been unearthed after being buried for ages Always iconic most of the objects that he turns into stone refer to the late 20th century or millennial era when technological obsolescence unprecedentedly accelerated along with the digital dematerialization of our world While the present the future and the past poetically collide in his haunted yet playful visions between romanticism and pop art Daniel Arsham also experiments with the timelessness of certain symbols and gestures across cultures

Jorinde Voigt has created a medium nominal Work on Paper on ink, gold leaf, acrylic, graphite on paper in the modern year of 2020.0 Voigts engagement with music and musical notations has always played an important role in Voigt s oeuvre In the Ludwig van Beethoven series she for example attempts to depict the music of Ludwig van Beethoven without illustrating or interpreting it The works of the series are reminiscent of the graphic scores of Iannis Xenakis or Mauricio Kagel yet they do not contain any instructions for action but are rather an expression of an emotional system of signs Everyday emotions and experiences are transported in music through melodic line volume and changes of tempo Voigt uses a coded notation that depicts the emotional spectrum inherent in Beethoven s music For this she extracts the intonation and dynamic notations from Beethoven s original text and makes them the basic framework of her works For Voigt these notes symbolize the personal traces left behind by the composer transcending the technical specifications With the help of the pictorial spaces she creates the complexity of the musical score thus visually opens up to the viewer

Ugo Mulas has created a small cheap Photography on Modern Print. Gelatin silver print on baritated paper on board. in the classic year of 1964.0 A sincere proof of contemporary art creation in the middle of the 20th century the work of Ugo Mulas came along with the change in the international art scene which had shifted its focus from the old to the new continent It was not until 1964 when after meeting the protagonists of new art at the Venice Biennale the already well known Italian photographer decided to cross the ocean and open a photographic archive of contemporary art creation in New York important not only for its great documentary value but also for its aesthetic dimension the result of an interesting reflection on photographic reality Lucio Fontana Marcel Duchamp or Roy Lichtenstein are just some of the artists who had opened the doors of their studios to Mulas Mulas photographed the artists as they worked and far from subjecting them to a particular style of portrait he adapted his photographic style to the artist s personality and way of working It is also interesting to note how this attention to the artistic process absorbs his own way of considering photography As the experience Mulas thinks not only of the final image but also of the reason why it originates the process that follows and then the possibility of showing it to viewers through various images as can be seen in the Roy Lichtenstein series When I photograph painters I often try to go beyond simple reportage and I also try not to capture the usual portrait or the beautiful portrait because what interests me is to highlight the artists in relation to the result of their work i e I try to understand which of their attitudes is crucial to the final result 
Elaine Cameron-Weir has created a large nominal Sculpture on concrete textile, stainless steel, neon tubing, transformer, tree stand, polished concrete, silk gauze  in the modern year of 2021.0 For Art Basel Statements 2021 JTT presents a new series of sculptures by New York based artist Elaine Cameron Weir Each piece on view has been constructed in tandem with a mirror opposite to complete three sets of imperfectly symmetrical objects The works incorporate a range of materials both found and manipulated including repurposed industrial objects raw construction materials laboratory hardware and theatrical lighting Evoking sites of provisional operations and also contemplative veneration the installation allows us to consider the ways in which artifice and spectacle have been used to perpetuate systems of belief Standing upright in the installation are a pair of crucifix forms lit with neon light and anchored to fragments of concrete flooring True to its function in commercial displays and signage the neon produces a hypnotic glow that recasts the object s utilitarian parts Underneath sumptuous drapery appears weightless but is actually made from heavy duty concrete cloth a material typically used to construct drainage ditches

Sherrie Levine has created a small expensive Photography on Sixty (60) giclée prints in the classic year of 2016.0 Learn more about Sherrie Levine Sherrie Levine s b 1947 work engages many of the core tenets of postmodern art in particular challenging notions of originality authenticity and identity Levine rose to prominence as a member of the Pictures Generation a group of artists centered in New York in the late 1970s and 1980s whose work examined the structures of signification underlying mass circulated images and in many cases directly appropriated these images in order to imbue them with new critically inflected meaning Since then Levine has created a singular and complex body of work in a variety of media including photography painting and sculpture that often explicitly reproduces artworks and motifs from the Western art historical canon As Johanna Burton observes Levine s practice underscores the ways in which art accumulates different meanings over time and in different contexts She suggests that how we see and understand things is conditioned by our own experiences collective and singular shared and private 1 After Russell Lee relates to Levine s ongoing practice of photographing reproductions of artworks begun in the early 1980s Lee was a lesser known contemporary of Walker Evans one of Levine s earliest and most recurrent subjects and was also a photographer employed by the Farm Security Administration FSA The FSA was an initiative of the American government created in 1935 to combat rural poverty in the wake of the Great Depression and was perhaps best known for its small but important photography program which existed until 1944 and helped bring public awareness to the challenges faced by the large number of Americans living outside of cities Simultaneously hailed as informative and derided as exploitative the now iconic images taken by the eleven photographers in the employ of the government have come to be regarded as works of art in their own right Here Levine revisits one of Lee s most influential projects a 1940 group of color photographs that depicts life in Pie Town New Mexico As Douglas Fogle explains On one level Levine s simple Duchampian gesture of appropriation presented an ardent attempt to disrupt the liturgical flow of the modernist story of art history with its focus on the heroic achievements of male artists by raising questions of authorship originality and attribution On another level her act of appropriation was not so much a negation as a strange kind of homage to her subjects Her rephotographed works were as she explained in some sense two photographs a photograph on top of a photograph which helped her create a metaphor by layering two images instead of putting them side by side It is the doubling effect produced in these works their creation of doppelg ngers of well known images that has given them the power to disturb our sense of order while also opening them up for another kind of interpretive cathexis 21 Johanna Burton with Carrie Springer Sherrie Levine Mayhem Exh bro New York Whitney Museum of American Art 2011 p 1 2 Douglas Fogle The Last Picture Show in The Last Picture Show Artists Using Photography 1960 1982 Exh cat Minneapolis Walker Art Center 2003 p 18 
Nate Lowman has created a large expensive Painting on Oil, acrylic, alkyd, latex, ink, resin, dirt, and sugar on canvas on wood panel in fifty-eight (58) parts in the classic year of 2013.0 Learn more about Nate Lowman Nate Lowman b 1979 has become known for deftly mining images culled from art history the news and popular media transforming visual signifiers from these distinct sources into a diverse body of paintings sculptures and installations Since the early 2000s the artist has continually pushed the boundaries of his multimedia approach with works that are at turns political humorous and poetic Through his art which dynamically explores themes of representation celebrity obsession and violence Lowman stages an encounter with commonplace universally recognizable motifs questioning and revisiting their intended meanings while creating new narratives in the process Having amassed a visual archive of source material Lowman often processes the significance of images over time typically returning to a picture on several occasions before making it the subject of one of his multivalent works The artist s sociological impulse as art critic David Rimanelli notes is to research and catalogue a world that is for all its immediacy more customarily and more comfortably seen at a distance 1Untitled comprises a vast canvas map of the United States Each state is created from fragments of soiled drop cloth in varying shades of color that bear the traces of different media from his studio practice including oil paint acrylic alkyd resin as well as dirt and sugar Each state is stretched on its own shaped canvas and combined into a whole on the wall in their correct geographic relation to one another with subtle gaps between the pieces that render it almost like a jigsaw puzzle The largest and most formally complex of the artist s map series this work is distinguished in its compositional format of combined individual parts Lowman s other maps are composed of states that have been stitched together to form a whole Untitled reflects Lowman s ongoing fascination with the representation of America and its complexities and contradictions The work takes the charged symbol of a map to explore and critique the effects of history and the arbitrariness of borders As the artist has noted My goal is to dislodge the illusion that the country we live in is a fixed thing I would like to suggest a destabilization of the map through the serializing of it referencing other historical times when the map was different and territories were different The country is not fixed Borders are in flux The way it is now is not even how it should be 2 1 David Rimanelli Nate Lowman The Brant Foundation Art Study Center Artforum May 2013 p 332 2 Nate Lowman cited in the press release for the artist s 2018 exhibition of his maps at Gagosian New York 
Johannes Kahrs has created a medium nominal Painting on oil on canvas in the classic year of 2014.0 The work of Johannes Kahrs confronts us with images that are difficult to place at first sight In tactilely translated fragments we can find references to politics religion history media and more personal or private subjects By means of Kahrs specific pictorial treatment the subject matter is infused with an intensified form of corporality sensuality that threatens to break into fever In the most recent work there often is an almost fetishistic focus on body parts like hands legs lips and torsos The recognizable aesthetics of Kahrs work fills the image with a sense of arousal or infection The colours which resemble more or less the spectrum of a bruise contribute to the rather obscure implications of the image These implications never become a real theme the paintings of Kahrs remain speculative in their apparent sense of physical and emotional doom As if true beauty has a natural ally in concealed disease implicated nausea emotional instability and the futile attempt to take a legitimate position towards the visual output of contemporary society Gerrit Vermeiren

 has created a medium nominal Sculpture on radiator in the classic year of 2017.0 Marepe s artistic practice is firmly rooted in his origins and in the events that have featured in his daily life Living and working in the city of Santo Ant nio de Jesus in the north of Brazil Marepe s poetic vision is permeated by a rich mix of themes that contain clear references to the typical features of his native Bahia There are allusions to the manufacturing and commercial activities in the territory to the popular traditions of the Rec ncavo Baiano as well as personal family and childhood memories of when he would stay for hours in his father s hardware store or when he spent his time observing the ingenuity of the street vendors in Bahia One fundamental and recurrent feature of Marepe s works is his appropriation of everyday objects which he finds at markets or in shops that sell useful practical things He systematically de contextualises and reinvents them assembling them in compositions that express purely personal and improbable associations thus redefining their nature form and meaning Even though he is influenced by the Dadaist movement in Marepe s case the use of ready mades has its roots in very different needs He refers to the objects in his sculptural compositions as necessidades necessities rather than ready mades for he captures and makes use of aspects that point to the great social and economic relevance they have for the Brazilian countryside and in particular for the Bahia region The basic structure that the artist uses when creating his works is based on their memory and forms and on the peculiar simplicity and spontaneity of the materials and on particular chromatic compositions In this way Marepe encourages us to observe and study objects we are familiar with and that reveal qualities that would normally be concealed from or unnoticed by most people This is how his Radiador simple air conditioning radiators turn into bare canvases on which he sketches landscapes animals and figures that recall his childhood

Vittorio Brodmann has created a small   Painting on Oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Vittorio Brodmann s work touches on a number of painting traditions as well modern cartoons His compositions and themes disclose references in equal measure from the surreal automatism of Andr Masson and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner s intense colour palette to traditional Japanese Yokai prints renderings of phantom like entities often with no distinct shape Sitcom set ups and one liners can be seen to inform Brodmann in tandem with the aesthetics of early Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network animations Figures slip into undefinable shapes and forms assuming both comical and misshapen proportions Features exaggerated noses are elongated and butts protrude all up against landscapes and backgrounds whose tones recall popular cartoons As animated figures and doodles collapse and mutate into each other across the canvas Brodmann marries deliberate approach with coincidence the scenarios hold defined narratives but ultimately remain open Brodmann continuously entertains this balance most notably in situating the works in between the slapstick and earnest

Josh Smith has created a large expensive Painting on Oil on linen in six (6) parts in the modern year of 2020.0 Learn more about Josh Smith Josh Smith b 1976 is a New York based painter who also produces collages sculptures prints and artist s books He first became known in the early 2000s for a series of canvases depicting his own name a motif that allowed him to experiment freely with abstraction and figuration and the expressive possibilities of painting He has since turned to monochromes gestural abstractions and series centered on varied imagery including leaves fish skeletons sunsets and palm trees among other motifs Smith s work engages in a celebratory and prolific project of experimentation and refinement upending the conventions of painting while simultaneously commanding a deep awareness of its history The present work is a frieze like polyptych comprising six panels depicting empty streetscapes It is from a series of works inspired by Smith s neighborhood environs as he experienced them during early morning and nighttime walks around a locked down New York during the 2020 quarantine As Smith notes The air was so clean Without all the cars and the people I could look up and see where I was It was soft and not threatening The colors the edges the relationships of things appeared with clarity 1 The works display an accidental history of both industrial and residential building styles At the same time the loosely rendered expressionistic paintings transcend any specific time or place The resultant canvases speak to the long tradition of the cityscape in the history of painting as well as the eerie beauty and serenity of the urban spaces of a closed and wounded world These are memory paintings says Smith but the memory I am painting is now 2 Elaborating on this series Ann C Collins writes Choosing a cool palette of greens and blues for street and sky Smith creates a forlorn environment into which he angles houses and buildings in vibrant hues of red yellow and pink There is not a figure to be seen but a warm glow of orange in the windows of his edifices hints at the lives unfolding within The work has the feel of an old children s book I thought of Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel 1939 and Curious George 1941 but it also evokes 20th century depictions of American cities by Stuart Davis and Louis Lozowick 3A unique endeavor for the artist and the largest single work he s created the multi panel work constitutes a synthetic whole even while each individual panel can stand on its own What was developing was a sort of city notes Smith of this work Each painting functions on its own or in the group but the six individual canvases coalesced into one large painting was the more powerful statement 4 By taking the city as his subject Smith effectively weds his visual practice to a shared social form that is itself an emblem of limitless possibility Like the street these paintings offer themselves to the viewer opening themselves to individual experience 1 Smith in conversation with the gallery August 2020 2 Smith in conversation with the gallery May 2020 3 Ann C Collins Josh Smith High as Fuck The Brooklyn Rail July August 2020 accessed online 4 Smith in conversation with the gallery August 2020

Jason Martin has created a large nominal Painting on Mixed media on aluminium in the classic year of 2015.0 The move from the flat surface into the third dimension with its resulting optical and tactile stimuli is characteristic for Jason Martin s work In this painting it is not the light reflex that generates the spatial impression rather the paste like application of the paint itself becomes three dimensional The rough blue colour pigments of the picture surface absorb all the reflexes The materiality of the paint is also addressed the powdery surface permits no direct definition of material meaning that the colour itself becomes a carrier of meaning

Ettore Spalletti has created a large expensive Painting on Color impasto on board, gold leaf in the classic year of 2013.0  Since the mid 70s Ettore Spalletti Cappelle sul Tavo 1940 Spoltore 2019 has created a language that is suspended between painting and sculpture focusing on light and space an approach which is reminiscent of both modern abstract art and the geometry of Renaissance painting His chromatic backgrounds cover essential forms which through the apparent containment within their geometric outlines become evocative due to the quality of the painting with which they are imbued The forms are drawn then transferred to wood paper or stone and finally painted The drawing is therefore simply the support for the work which only comes into being when the paint materialises The thickness of the paint is obtained by applying successive layers of mixtures of plaster and pigments a slow process which takes account of the varying times required for the paint to dry The colour is only revealed in the final moment of this long process when abrasion causes the decomposition of the pigments making the surfaces powdery like velvety skin with an infinite range of shades and tonal variations The drawing gradually drowns in the emerging body of paint and attains the statute that Spalletti establishes for it that of the outline There is no painting in the traditional sense of the term but identification between paint and support there is no sculpture in the sense of shaping because the abrasive paper cancels all signs of emotivity Spalletti s works are painted in delicate colours over which he always applies white chalk This prevents the paint from setting in a definitive structure giving the surfaces a breadth that alludes to life and its figurativeness Arranging colours one after the other in order to describe an image taking the observer on a voyage into the unknown blue is an atmospheric colour the blues I use in my works are always different they can even be distinguished by almost imperceptible quantities of paint I use blue because it is a colour which never presents itself through the surface of its existence but is a colour in which we are continuously immersed And the same goes for pink I use pink because it is the colour of the flesh so it can always be transformed according to our emotions In the drowsiness of the sea we can find silver grey Grey is welcoming it is a colour that moves towards white but also towards black which offers the highest quality of all colours

Mario García Torres has created a medium nominal Painting on photocopy toner on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0  For years I have been interested in the missing elements of a tale of history and thinking about what those left out parts say about ourselves This is prevalent on many of my works from the last 15 years You could name almost any of them What Happens in Halifax Stays in Halifax Unspoken Dailies Have You Ever Seen The Snow The hollow parts of a tale I have learnt are only visible when one puts tight attention to what surrounds it to what defines it The forms in this dimensional works are defined by a set of instructions set in the hope to find the hollow parts of a narrative the forms that define the missing parts The works in the Stray Series such as the ones shown here are made by pouring toner a runny dust composed of microscopic grains used normally to make photocopies In them a narrative emerges as you see how the forms take shape as the material advanced through the surface One could say these are time based works that in this case runs from top to bottom The works document the slightest changes in the environment where they are made that provoked the particles to run one way or another They are the negotiation between the gesture and the environment When I was a kid I worked making photocopies and I always had an attraction for that aesthetic that a copy like that provoked which I have used in a number of works These works were created after looking for long time precisely to photocopiers errors and mistakes that are most of the times lines formed by leaks of toner left out by the cartridges that are not working properly The forms on these canvases emulate that since the toner behaves in a similar way inside and outside the machine These works seem to be enlarged photocopies that are pure mistakes pure errors They only reproduce the irreproducible the accident Much can be said about both the history of the photocopier in art and the history of the gesture and the pouring in art Jackson Pollock smashed paint on a canvas in the 1950 s changing the way paint should be applied and which dramatically deviated the history of painting Ten years later with a whole different mindset Robert Smithson poured glue or asphalt on the environment which greatly digressed the symbol on a material and its relationship to its context On the other side the history of photocopy in art is long Since its inception in the 1960 s the photocopier yet another almost obsolete technology like film and slide projectors was immediately adopted by a number of artists who first put objects on its glass to those who ended up making movies with it Some of them were attracted by the cheapness and deadpan aesthetic others by the reproducibility and the fact that it was a machine that defined their work I recently conceived a piece in homage to Alighiero Boetti who I have largely researched and who precisely did a number of works in a photocopier He used the machine in different moments in his career once to photocopy all media newspapers and magazines he bought and others in a more conceptual way like photocopying the rain As part of the show Take Me I am Yours I proposed to have a photocopy machine available for people to copy whatever they could find as long as the papers used was red as it was the color that Boetti used to bound the books he made of photocopy collections As one engages with the Stray Series it s not difficult to think of other monochromatic approaches to a canvas like Martin Barr or Lee Ufan who have arrived to some of the most concrete and elemental gestures which make us think back about humans and their relationship to materials In the Stray Series there is no explicit plot there is no precise linearity but there are actions that generate a stray and uncertain narrative This for me is the intrigue which has provoked me to look through history for years This has made me arrived at this series which bring all stories and narratives that I have been looking far away from me in history in far flung places With this I found those leaks and those accidents in me in my studio Mario Garc a Torres 2019
Lara Favaretto has created a medium nominal Painting on found painting, wool in the modern year of 2020.0 A painting on canvas is entirely covered with a black woollen thread which both protects and hides it leaving just a vague glimpse of the female portrait beneath This work is one of a series the artist started in 2010 all of which follow the same process paintings found or bought on the Internet at a flea market or from an antique dealer are entrusted to a wool worker who has devised a special technique for wrapping the entire surface of the canvas uniformly using a single thread pulled absolutely taut Applied vertically and tied to the back of the frame the thread forms a dense warp which veils the painting beneath while also making it more captivating The colour of the wool which is chosen to match the tones of the painting conceals or by contrast reveals the subject underneath it which might be a landscape or a still life a genre scene or a portrait a mythological scene or a purely geometrical abstraction In most cases the paintings are single but there have also been diptychs and triptychs The title of the work is that of the colour number of the wool used based on the Pantone chart with the sole exceptions of black and white which always appear as such The range of Pantone colours also establishes the maximum potential number of works in the series Through this operation the canvases which are made by generally unknown amateurs are saved from oblivion only to be returned to anonymity hidden beneath their unusual lining The wool which is chosen from warehouse remainders or from factories when it goes out of production is thus salvaged by the artist who while giving up total control of the work also promotes the principle of sustainability and disposal of an existing product This process augments the vulnerability of the works which is already implicit in the use of wool a material that is delicate and that deteriorates easily The condition imposed by the peculiar process of creation which involves the use of materials that are out of production means that the thread cannot be replaced if it breaks for the same type of wool is no longer available and the use of a different colour would contradict the title of the work which is that of the Pantone number This limitation accentuates the contrast between showing and concealing that is already inherent in the work depending on the angle it is observed from it may appear as a monochrome surface or as a complex pictorial composition preventing any complete rewarding view of it The thread must be extremely taut in order to ensure this essential effect but the strain it is subjected to means there is a risk that as time goes by it might break revealing the painting beneath which would thus be stripped of the enigmatic power it is given by the woollen filter The possibility of irremediable damage being caused is an inherent part of the work and it creates a sense of tension and expectation in the viewers as well as the realisation that they are observing a process that is still under way The complete removal of the broken thread marks a point of no return and the start of the final phase of the work which is that of revealing the painting making it appear in its own brazen ingenuousness and ironically bringing into question both its own legitimacy in view of its new look and its real auteurship

Clare Woods has created a medium nominal Painting on Oil on aluminium in the modern year of 2020.0 This work by Clare Woods was painted in the build up to and during the first lock down in an intense and isolated period which allowed Woods to occupy a position where she could compare the past and the idea of the future closely as the present was so unrecognisable and uncomfortable I found it so hard to describe what I was feeling and the only way it could be translated into something real was through painting it I was trying to capture those moments in the home and the focus shift for outside to inside where everything familiar felt unfamiliar and where the detail in the everyday became heightened re seeing the ordinary in a different way I felt as though I was occupying a position on both sides of a boundary of a very transformative space All of Clare Woods paintings are based on photographs sometimes her own sometimes found imagery The cropping and editing of the original photograph through drawing removes some of the form so that they begin to sit on the edge of legibility and figuration Woods conceptually empties the source image but then replaces a new interpretation during the act of painting This physical break down of the image allows a slowing down and falling apart of the visual partly forcing the viewer to question their ability to decipher the content of what is in front of them and partly questioning what it means to live in a time of mass image consumption and in a world that treats banality and disaster in the same way

Carolyn Lazard has created a large cheap Sculpture on Granite in the modern year of 2021.0  In a linguistic sleight of hand the main space of SYNC is spatially rooted in the display of four separate bathroom sinks three ceramic and one metal each in its naked state without faucets or plumbing Three of the sinks are presented on the wall at picture height with the well of the basin facing the viewer while the fourth sits upright on a TV cart The allusion is immediately recognizable the rectangular form of the sink mirroring that of a television set with the basin s concave space neatly summoning the illusory depth of a screen The works titles TV 1 Dead Time TV 2 Against Metaphor TV 3 Love Island and TV 4 Delayed Reception all 2020 further both this sense of metamorphosis and the familiar disposition of TV watching at once inactive receptive and anticipatory Both washbasin and TV speak to everyday habits and rituals of regeneration in their coming together there is the sense of the different ways in which they call upon bodily movement perception and affect to generate both image and action In the TV pieces object and image are enfolded in the durational phenomenology of reflecting light on the sinks surfaces of metal and ceramic The viewer is cast into a space of attention where bodily presence and extended temporality intersect Richard Birkett in Mousse Magazine 73 2020

Lorna Simpson has created a large expensive Painting on Ink and screenprint on gessoed fiberglass in the modern year of 2021.0 Monumentally scaled and deeply mesmerizing Midnight LA time 2021 is an outstanding example of Lorna Simpson s painting practice As Simpson has spent the majority of her three decade career as a conceptual photographer and collagist this work is a testament to the artist s ever expanding and multi disciplinary oeuvre Arresting and poetic Midnight LA time engages with themes central to Simpson s wider practice including questions of representation identity gender and race which she explores in relation to memory and history Midnight LA time belongs to a new body of work that expands on Simpson s acclaimed Ice series incorporating appropriated imagery from vintage Ebony and Jet magazines found photo booth images which have been key sources for Simpson over the last decade and Associated Press photographs featuring natural elements 1 Over the past few years Simpson has developed a preoccupation with ice and has sourced imagery of glaciers as well as oceans mountain tops and smoke Simpson layers these images alongside texts and advertisements depicting women from her collection of Ebony and Jet magazines which she then silkscreens onto fiberglass panels and gessoes into gestural and fluid expressions of ink creating surreal and imagined environments By doing so the artist reconfigures a diverse array of visual culture in unexpected ways developing a distinct language using the found image as a source and encouraging new narratives to emerge from unexpected origins The result is a highly complex layered body of work that is simultaneously figurative and abstract realistic and phantasmic In Midnight LA time Simpson depicts a mystifying landscape washed with tempered shades of deep grey that sit in stark contrast to a startling blue Barely discernible vertical strips of text and the fragmented sliver of a woman s face swim to the surface drenched in inky washes of grey A pervasive and somber haze imbues the scene with the feeling of a memory or a dream Here as elsewhere Simpson is sparing in her use of color her disciplined palette of inky blacks and greys is cinematic recalling her earlier works such as Cloudscape 2004 The artist s use of close ups and extreme cropping hallmarks of her pioneering approach to conceptual photography draw the viewer s focus to the work s fragmented elements As Simpson explains the notion of fragmentation especially of the body is prevalent in our culture We re fragmented not only in terms of how society regulates our bodies but in the way we think about ourselves 2 Midnight LA time demonstrates Simpson s mastery of paint and the evolution of her practice As noted by Joan Simon author of a celebrated monograph on her work Simpson s search for different images and different mediums for different ways of addressing the body even through its absence is a through line from the outset of her career 3 Layered and multivalent Simpson s practice deploys metaphor metonymy and formal prowess to offer a potent response to life today 1 For Simpson the female figures in these magazines chronicle periods and expressions of self determination serving as a lens into American history Equally the Associated Press photographs have been a wellspring of inspiration for Simpson serving as the basis for seminal works such as Waterbearer 1986 and Riunite Ice 2014 2018 2 Lorna Simpson Lorna Simpson Unanswerable London Hauser Wirth 2018 press release 3 Joan Simon Easy to Remember Hard to Forget Lorna Simpson s Gestures and Reenactments in Lorna Simpson Munich London and New York DelMonico Books Prestel Publishing 2013 pp 18 19 
Richard Serra has created a small expensive Work on Paper on Oilstick on handmade paper in the classic year of 2005.0 The present work is closely related to Richard Serra s 2005 A Drawing in Five Parts located in the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York On this series the museum has commented Renowned as a maker of large scale often site specific sculptures Richard Serra has throughout his career also produced drawings that are at once independent from and deeply tied to his three dimensional work Since the early 1970s Serra has used black oil stick compressed tubes of paint pigment and wax to make drawings that like his sculptures strive to explore the limits of the medium and engage the viewer s phenomenological experience of the work The curves of A Drawing in Five Parts and related works on paper were inspired in part by the subtly shifting slopes of the sand dunes on the San Francisco beach where Serra grew up and in part by the arching lines raked into the sand in the Zen gardens of Kyoto To create the drawings Serra first melted a number of paintsticks He then evenly spread the now fluid medium onto a worktable and covered it with metal mesh Next he placed sheets of paper facedown on top and pressed a stylus onto the verso of the paper forcing the liquefied medium through the screen and onto the surface Like Serra s sculpture the sequential drawings with their nestled arcs suggest motion and imply the passage of time 1On the occasion of the artist s 2011 12 drawing retrospective which was organized by The Menil Collection in Houston and traveled to The Metropolitan Museum of Art and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art The Menil Collection noted In the last 25 years Serra has continued to invent new drawing techniques In the late 1980s he explored how to further articulate the tension of weight and gravity by placing pairs of overlapping sheets of paper saturated with paintstick in horizontal and vertical compositions Since the 1990s he has embarked on numerous series with a remarkable variety of surface effects Often working on the floor and using a mesh screen as an intermediary between the gesture and the transfer of pigment to the paper he persists to achieve effects that offer new ways to consider drawing In short Serra is among a significant group of artists whose transformative work irrevocably changed the practice and definition of modernist drawing and challenged drawing s role in the traditional hierarchy of media 21 Richard Serra A Drawing in Five Parts 2005 The Metropolitan Museum of Art https www metmuseum org art collection search 498184 2 Richard Serra Drawing A Retrospective The Menil Collection https www menil org exhibitions 23 richard serra drawing a retrospective

Andy Warhol has created a small   Painting on Acrylic and silkscreen ink on canvas in the classic year of 1979.0 In 1978 at the age of 50 perhaps to look back on his career Andy Warhol began recreating some of his most famous motifs from the decade prior in a series he called Reversals The present work titled Multicolored Retrospective is considered a subset of the series as a whole in which the artist considered images purely from 1961 to 1972 Each image already considered pillars in the cannon of art history as they were oft painted by the artist For this subseries Warhol chose his Flowers Cow Wallpaper Photo Booth Self Portrait Kellogg s Corn Flakes Box Car Crash Electric Chair Campbell s Soup Can Mona Lisa Marilyn Monroe and his Chairman Mao Of the ten globally recognizable icons the latter five listed are featured in the present work 
Lynda Benglis has created a small expensive Sculpture on handmade paper over chicken wire, coal tempera, pigmented acrylic medium, watercolor, gold leaf in the classic year of 2013.0 Since the 1960s Lynda Benglis has been celebrated for the free ecstatic forms she has made that are simultaneously playful and visceral organic and abstract Benglis began her career in the midst of Postminimal art pushing the traditions of painting and sculpture into new territories Benglis initiated several bodies of work in the late 1960s and early 1970s that set the course for her subsequent practice Her wax paintings which began with brushed skin like layers of pigmented beeswax and dammar resin transitioned into the use of a blowtorch as a kind of brush manipulating colors into a marbleized surface that seemingly fought against the constraints of the lozenge shaped Masonite panels The impulse to see these forms flow beyond the structure of a traditional support led Benglis to embrace pigmented latex which she began pouring directly onto the floor The use of gravity and her body in the latex pours invoked Jackson Pollock s process a connection immortalized in the February 27 1970 edition of Life magazine which featured Benglis at work Concurrently she began working with pigmented polyurethane foam building the volume of her sculptures vertically by pouring the oozing lava like forms against walls and in the corners of spaces or over constructed armatures and chicken wire that once solidified were mounted to the wall Benglis s totem like sculptures followed as long cylindrical structures made of wire mesh cotton bunting and plaster that by 1972 she began to tie into knots Painted with metallic sparkle Sculp Metal or layers of sprayed vaporized aluminum copper zinc or tin the works are complicated further by the reflections of their surfaces conflating the sculptural object with painterly space The contorted shapes formed by the artist s hands express the bodily force used by Benglis throughout her career continuing with her gold sculptures of the late 1970s and early 1980s In the early 1970s Benglis took new media technologies as her material producing video art at a time when it was still in its early stages as a medium Her experimental videos feature performative actions and technological mediation to explore themes of physical presence narcissism sexuality and gendered identity Physical and Psychological Moments in Time a retrospective of video works by Benglis was held in 1975 by Fine Arts Center Gallery State University of New York College at Oneonta and traveled to Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven Netherlands Benglis also introduced images of herself into the public discourse including a 1974 Artforum ad to challenge assumptions about self presentation and gender in the male dominated art world Benglis extended her innovative use of materials in 1984 when she first used water as an element in her sculptures She won the competition to create a fountain for that year s Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans resulting in The Wave of the World 1983 84 in cast bronze She has gone on to create numerous other sculptural fountains including Chimera 1988 Double Fountain Mother and Child For Anand 2007 at Le Jardin Botanique de Dijon France and North South East West 2009 at the Irish Museum of Modern Art Dublin With moving water incorporated into their compositions her fountains convey fluidity in physical and thematic terms The embrace of flowing forms color and sensual surfaces plays a large part in Benglis s continuous investigation of the proprioceptive sensory experiences of making and viewing her sculptures From the complex chromatic harmonies of the wax paintings to the selected use of brilliant Day Glo pigments or phosphorescence in her latex and foam sculptures Benglis s exuberant engagement with color along with her radical employment of material sets her apart from the more achromatic focus of her Minimalist and Postminimal contemporaries 
Vítor Pomar has created a large nominal Photography on inkjet print in the classic year of 1970.0 V tor Pomar has been a prominent figure in the Portuguese art context since the 1970s His conceptual approach bears the influence of Buddhism specifically Buddhist meditation and the spiritual at large Although rooted in the medium of painting the work of V tor Pomar brings together a multitude of artistic approaches crossing painting with the experience of drawing photography and film His work emerges from reuniting seemingly dispersed experiences inscribed in daily life which through a diary like method based on fragmentation observation and creation of images captures the artist s interest in the conceptualization of ideas connected with the subject of absolute existence Photography occupies a crucial part in Pomar s practice Part of a generation of artists who have questioned the purpose of photography as documentation and as a representational tool connected to the construction of narrative Pomar s photographs instead capture the fleeting the somewhat insignificant that of the everyday Flowers for M B The Seventies 1970 captures moments from the artist s life studio and immediate surroundings Despite the rare appearance of the human figure the photographs translate a sense of intimacy achieved by the framing of the selected subject frequently abstracting it from its initial context and making it instead part of the artist s personal universe Dedicated to Marie Beatriz Pomar s long term partner and author of his portraiture in the right bottom corner of the work the work is a visual poem a conceptualization of photography and a fragment from the artist s life Depicting among other studies of works from the artist studio Flowers for M B The Seventies is a crucial piece in the artist s ouvre and a predecessor of Pomar s future artistic language namely that of his black and white series of abstract paintings which emerged in the mid 1970s

Elaine Cameron-Weir has created a large nominal Sculpture on Steel fire door, cast iron, glass slab, aluminum, theatre spot light, hardware in the modern year of 2021.0 In a set of double fire doors a faint glow emanates through thick amber colored glass portals framed in cast iron Are the doors a protective barrier from the source of light or a gate keeping us from it Are we to choose the left path or the right Propped against a wall they ve been removed from their function and reveal the source of their glow to be a pair of stage lights Just as mirrors are often accomplices to elaborate magic tricks the objects and their doubles play on our innate desire to find meaning in visual allure repetition and material transformation even after their machinations have been revealed

Not Vital has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas, framed and glazed in the classic year of 2012.0 Everything around me is emptied everything almost loses gravity like floating or falling or daydreaming This might be one of the reasons why most of the space surrounding the heads and most of the canvas is left untouched When a head stands alone I work better No need to add anything it would just be more Not VitalNot Vital s art is often inspired by his nomadic lifestyle and global travels reflecting on habitations nature and animals and on intersections between sculpture and architecture He often collaborates with skilled craftsmen around the world ranging from Beijing steel chasers and Murano glass blowers to Tuareg silversmiths and Bhutan papermakers Exploring the boundaries between abstract and figurative forms his work is marked by a particularly intimate relationship with materials including plaster steel marble ceramic and organic matter Likewise the artist s painting practice which he began 12 years ago allows him to explore or express a unique relationship with the subjects of his portraits These are created through a process of application and reduction repeatedly adding and then removing layers of paint until the figure seems to emerge from the material These works represent the introspective and personal counterpoint to his sculptural practice although both are informed by an innate sensitivity to light space and form As he describes Painting is the best way for me to see feel and smell light In The Idiot after Dostoyevsky 2012 Vital references the 19th century novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky which was first published in 1868 69 The titular idiot is the novel s protagonist Prince Myshkin whose na ve goodness and simplicity are at odds with the more worldly characters he encounters Dostoyevsky sought to portray the purity of a truly beautiful soul and the perils that innocence and goodness face in a corrupt world There is also a more prosaic reference in Vital s work to the tradition of the village idiot a stereotypically ignorant but often good natured local figure The monochrome palette rendered in subtle shades of white grey and black reflect the colour asceticism of his youth spent in the Swiss Engadin valley also known as the Grisons or the land of the grey The artist explains if you grow up in a surrounding where you have snow for six months of the year your eyes are naturally sensitive to white Then when the snow melts the mountains turn grey So I became accustomed to these nuances in grey and white and not so much colour The minimalism of these portraits in which details are pared down to their essentials focuses attention on the relationship between form and space This reduction makes you look at it more closely and more attentively since the painting doesn t jump in your face with loud colours says Vital Not only does it invite you to look at it more closely and more precisely but it draws you in like a magnet the painting becomes more mysterious and is endowed with more depth The subject s head floats like an orb above a spectral body in an undefined space replacing an emphasis on the identifying features of a face with consideration of the overall form Preoccupied with the expression of an inner reality these works highlight the potency of essence as opposed to detail As he describes The void or the unpainted areas on my canvases are by no means empty They only represent a certain uncertainty An integral part of the work the glazed frame functions as a form of skin that unifies and contains the painting simultaneously inviting the viewer in and keeping them at a certain distance Creating reflections that can obscure the image from certain angles the glass layer forces the viewer to physically negotiate the act of looking repositioning themselves in order to fully experience the work

Nicole Eisenman has created a large expensive Sculpture on Bronze, concrete, mixed media in the modern year of 2020.0 Exemplifying the irreverent and profoundly original visual language that has come to characterize Nicole Eisenman s oeuvre Procession Maquette 2020 equally demonstrates the artist s fluidity in working across media and scale Although widely known for their painting practice the artist s turn to sculpture represents a logical extension from one compositional space to another By materializing forms into three dimensions they engage with relational awareness in a nuanced and playful manner Here Eisenman offers an intimately sized reproduction of Procession a monumental sculpture installation conceived for the Whitney Biennial where it was first unveiled in 2019 and subsequently exhibited at The Contemporary Austin Texas in 2020 and the Astrup Fearnley Museet Oslo in 2021 Arising from the artist s desire to create an accessible version of its gargantuan predecessor Procession Maquette is not a replica in the strict sense of the term but rather a re rendering of five of the original personages Poised to lumber in unison the advancement of this small caravan is both implied and undermined with each character appearing forlorn dejected or completely self absorbed Taking on an air of abject pageantry the procession is led by the burly Perpetual Motion Machine overburdened yet seemingly undaunted by the task of pulling an ineffective dolly upon which rests the central element Museum Piece con Gas in a posture of worship The theme of grouped wanderers is located throughout Eisenman s work visible in The Triumph of Poverty 2009 and The Darkward Trail 2018 And as with Procession Maquette a nod to Titian s Bacchus and Ariadne 1520 1523 the structures of these tableaux reflect the artist s encyclopedic knowledge of Western painting Here Eisenman opens the sculpture to multiple readings as a satirical offering of art historical pomp wayward patriotism and as a reference to protest evoking a sense of gravitas and humor

Alex Katz has created a small expensive Painting on Oil on board in the classic year of 1989.0 Utilizing characteristically wide brushstrokes large swathes of color and refined compositions Alex Katz has over the past six decades established himself as a preeminent painter of modern life whose distinctive portraits and lyrical landscapes bear a flattened surface and consistent economy of line Although perhaps best known for his striking portraits flowers and landscapes have also long played a significant role in Katz s practice Since the summer of 1949 when he attended the Skowhegan School of Painting Sculpture Katz has split most of his time between New York and Maine with the latter locale inspiring the tightly cropped floral motifs and landscapes that are at the forefront of his work In depicting a dotting of wildflowers shadows on a field of grass or a sunset peeking through the woods Katz employs his masterful handling of light color and space to capture the flora and landscapes just as they appear to him at specific moments in time Combining aspects of both abstraction and representation these paintings make us see the world the way Katz sees it clear and up close with all but the most essential details pared away 1An integral part of his painting practice Katz uses sketches and smaller oil studies on board to capture the initial essence of whatever has captivated him and to develop and perfect this essence before translating it to a larger canvas These studies are Katz s way of staying true to the shock of the original perception His subject is the present tense of seeing not something recollected in tranquility 2 The studies then offer an intimate window into Katz s initial impressions and artistic process Critic John Russell discussed the Black Brook series on the occasion of the artist s 1996 exhibition at the Colby College Museum of Art in Maine Envelopment was fundamental to those paintings Both cityscape and landscape defined themselves in terms of an all enveloping intrusion upon the painter s own space Sometimes the right new subject turned up at the right new time as when in 1986 the Katzes bought a piece of land across the road from their house in Maine It had a brook going through it called Black Brook Katz wrote later It was dark brown because of the trees over it The Black Brook series went on for years I wanted to make an environmental landscape where you were in it And in a painting like the Black Brook X of 1990 at Colby we truly are in it as distinct from standing back and looking at landscape from a safe distance 3 Many paintings from the Black Brook series such as the present work depict a cropped reflection of the nearby landscape as it appears on the water s surface thus inverting the image Several paintings from this series were prominently featured in the 2015 16 traveling exhibition Alex Katz This Is Now at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao 1 Calvin Tomkins Alex Katz s Life in Art in The New Yorker August 27 2018 https www newyorker com magazine 2018 08 27 alex katzs life in art 2 John Yau Alex Katz at 90 in Alex Katz Grass and Trees Chicago Richard Gray Gallery 2018 p 20 21 3 John Russell Introduction to the Colby College Catalogue 1996 reproduced in Alex Katz Twenty Five Years of Painting from the Saatchi Collection London The Saatchi Gallery 1997 p 190 
Yuan Yuan has created a large expensive Painting on Oil on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Yuan Yuan depicts most patiently and rationally an uncanny realm in his paintings merged in which are displaced scenes fantasies based upon reality personal experiences and the singular aesthetics of immanence of the artist They depict claustrophobic spaces the places are seemingly lively but human figures are definitely absent As soon as the spaces are abandoned they are turned from private territories into public spaces Yuan compares this transformation with the fate of an artwork as soon as it is gazed upon by a spectator the artist abandons his exclusive possession of it The viewer gradually identifies the time and space depicted in the painting and in the same process identifies his or her own perspective arriving not only in a painted world but also his or her own projection Expressing the absence of human by depicting the traces left behind Yuan s painting takes exactly the excess of details as its subject emphasising on even the most trivial details

Robert Irwin has created a large expensive Sculpture on Shadow + Reflection + Color in the classic year of 2017.0 Robert Irwin is a pioneering figure in the Light and Space movement anchoring a generation of artists with his phenomenological experimentation with light color and display Irwin often conjures notions of either places or sounds with titles such as Harlem Nocturne 2014 15 South South West 2014 15 and the present work IBIZA 2017 Irwin s use of fluorescent lighting dates back to the 1970s when he abandoned his studio practice and began exploring the effects of light color shadow and reflection with his site conditioned works In keeping with his interest in broader themes of light and display Irwin here lists his medium not as gel film on fluorescent bulbs but Shadow Reflection Color His rhetorical choice of medium displaces the physical object locating the work as the phenomenal and perceptual sensations produced by these immaterial conditions altering the exhibition space and the viewer s field of vision Consistent with Irwin s practice his light sculptures influence viewers to consider how we perceive the world through sensation and perception 
Lucas Samaras has created a small nominal Work on Paper on pastel on paper in the classic year of 1974.0 Eliding historical categorization Lucas Samaras s oeuvre is united through its consistent focus on the body and psyche often emphasizing autobiography The theme of self depiction and identity has been a driving force behind his practice which at its onset in the early 1960s advanced the Surrealist idiom yet proposed a radical departure from the presiding themes of Abstract Expressionism and Pop art Samaras emigrated with his family from Greece to the United States in 1948 settling in West New York New Jersey He attended Rutgers University New Brunswick New Jersey studying under Allan Kaprow and George Segal and then at Columbia University New York where he studied art history under Meyer Schapiro His interest in self investigation began during this period when he initiated painting self portraits from the front and back using a mirror He also gravitated toward the use of pastels which enabled him to work quickly exploring figurative and geometrical forms in rich colors and with luxuriant texture characteristics that would reoccur throughout his work He soon shifted toward objects producing assemblage reliefs and boxes comprised of elements culled from his immediate surroundings and five and dime stores cutlery nails mirrors brightly colored yarn and feathers affixed with liquid aluminum or plaster His first New York exhibition was held at Reuben Gallery in 1959 which came on the heels of his first group show at the gallery Kaprow s 18 Happenings in 6 Parts Through his involvement at the Reuben Gallery and his participation in Happenings Samaras met Jim Dine Red Grooms and Claes Oldenburg He had met Robert Whitman another key figure in the Happenings movement while at Rutgers and the two collaborated on performances Samaras debuted his assemblage boxes in 1961 at Green Gallery New York For the artist the boxes possessed elements of sculpture architecture and painting amplified by the inclusion of objects such as mirrors and photographs additions that situated Samaras as one of the earliest artists to emphasize his ego and corporeal self in his art His early boxes led to his inclusion in his first institutional group show The Art of Assemblage held at The Museum of Modern Art New York in 1961 In 1965 Samaras joined Pace Gallery which mounted an exhibition of his works made between 1960 to 1966 that included Samaras immersive Room No 2 1966 also known as Mirrored Room A culmination of his mirrored boxes Room No 2 was his first installation to become a part of a museum collection acquired in 1966 by the Albright Knox Art Gallery Buffalo New York Samaras received his first major solo exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art New York in 1969 which was followed by his first international museum exhibition held at the Kunstverein Museum in Hanover 1970 By the mid 1970s he had also received his first large scale commission for which he produced Silent Struggle 1976 a sculpture comprised of Cor ten steel initially installed at the Hale Boggs Federal Courthouse in New Orleans In 1969 Samaras began to expand upon his use of photography experimenting with a Polaroid 360 camera which appealed to his sense of immediacy His innovation further materialized with his use of the Polaroid SX 70 in 1973 in a melding of self portraiture and abstraction created by manipulating the wet dye emulsions with a stylus or fingertip before the chemicals set This processed progressed with digital art in 1996 when he obtained his first computer and began to experiment with printed texts on typewriter paper By 2002 he had acquired a digital camera and the use of Photoshop became an integral component of his practice These technologies gave way to Photofictions 2003 a series characterized by distorted self portraits and psychedelic compositions Gesturing toward a larger investigation of self reflection in his work found in his mirror rooms self portraiture and use of digital mirror imaging Samaras s oeuvre acts as an extension of his body while underscoring the transformative possibilities of the everyday a true blurring of art and life

Ana Montiel has created a large cheap Painting on INITIATION: SEPARATION (Symphony No. 3, Op. 36 - III. Lento - Cantabile semplice) 7 in the modern year of 2021.0 Ana Montiel s art vibrates resonates and performs a kind of synaesthesia marrying noise and matter pixel and sound Indeed before setting to work the artist communes with her canvas thanks to a moment of musical and physical awakening She gathers the colours and applies them carefully with her spray gun The tints fuse superimpose then come to rest Detail by detail each grain of colour is adjusted according to a meticulous method of application of acrylics with some paintings having up to a hundred sub layers The effect is magnetic in much the same vein as the mystical installations of American artist James Turrell or the meditative velvets of the Italian Ettore Spaletti With her pictorial works Ana Montiel opens windows onto a world that topples us and shoves us towards new prophetic dimensions dimensions of the infinite and unknown Cl lia Dehon Head of Public Program at Louis Vuitton Foundation Text extracted from The Steidz magazine issue no 5

Alex Katz has created a small expensive Painting on Oil on linen in the modern year of 2020.0 Utilizing characteristically wide brushstrokes large swathes of color and refined compositions Alex Katz has over the past six decades established himself as a preeminent painter of modern life whose distinctive portraits and lyrical landscapes bear a flattened surface and consistent economy of line As Calvin Tomkins writes in a recent profile of the artist Katz had found a way to paint portraits that he described in a 1961 statement as brand new terrific Ignoring character and mood he offered the pure sensation of outward appearance not who the people were but how they appeared at a specific moment I can t think of anything more exciting than the surface of things he later told an interviewer 1 Although his models are often those that Katz knows best most notably his wife Ada rather than articulate certain intimate characteristics of family or friends that only he might be privy to Katz opts to present his models as they appear to him at a particular instant or particular instants as is the case in his double portraits and portrait series This gives his portraits a masterful sense of immediacy and forthrightness which make s us see the world the way Katz sees it clear and up close with all but the most essential details pared away 21 Calvin Tomkins Alex Katz s Life in Art in The New Yorker August 27 2018 https www newyorker com magazine 2018 08 27 alex katzs life in art2 Ibid Vivien looks you in the eye and stands firmly But still she will not stand for long The folds and ripples in the white coat she wears give clues to the fact that she may prefer to stay in motion As do the freely interlacing patterns of black lines on the blouse she put on under the coat Vivien looks around turns and is on her way One moment her dark hair cut to a bob parts evenly and makes her features speak out with pronounced presence as it frames them with perfect ease Yet as she starts to turn her hair swoops in adds spin to her lan and covers her face from view Vivien moves before a backdrop of bright light blue and look closely the seams of her coat at times appear to have a radiant yellow lining Hints of shadows on the left side of her face signal and safeguard a sense of inner life beyond the reach of the avid readerly gaze Another key thing about these shadows is that they wander From cheeks chin and contours over lapels and arms to folds of all kinds till they spread over the blue backdrop like fine currents rippling the surface of water throughout its entire expanse This is a soul moving relayed with simplest means yet in ever so many subliminally kinetic forms Jan Verwoert Paint somebody like you would call them by name in Alex Katz White Coat Chicago Richard Gray Gallery 2021 
Chou Yu-Cheng has created a medium nominal Painting on Acrylic on paper, paper mounted on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 The increased awareness of the environment has inspired the artist to use pigments more carefully treating pigments derived from organic inorganic chemicals metals or minerals as a pollutant and to refer to the gradations of colour that occur over time as a result of the movement of materials and water such as the natural arrangements of stones in the riverbeds made by the water flow or the gradations of the residual pollution from industrial wastewater discharges These are the result of time movement and sedimentation whereas the arrangement of the biomass on the paper is resulted by a colouring process that is inspired by nature and pollution In the Moody series distinctive gradient paper is applied to produce compositions of similar shapes It reads like a game where the subjective interpretation of the image by the viewer becomes a variable just as people have divergent interpretations on things for instance the aforementioned understanding of pigments For the artist it anthropomorphises the moment when the material order collapses as well as the solid but inarticulate hidden emotions just like the sorrow of human beings over the uncontrollable external environmental changes transformations or the pandemic age

José Guerrero has created a large expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1959.0 Signed Jos Guerrero lower right Jos Guerrero s painting shifted gradually towards abstraction from 1950 the year he moved to New York and completed his last figurative work a self portrait The artist would also later stop painting on bricks cement and blackboards which he called portable frescoes Contact with the painting of the New York School gave his work new impetus From that point forward it reflects an abstraction which advocates an emphasis on the visual aspects and on the work on the medium itself the colour and two dimensionality of the canvas Guerrero s advocacy of a visual experience free of any material or social conditioning is among the concepts most often repeated in his writing The artist associates this with a free art which offers space for his aspirations to complete autonomy and creative freedom Giving up figurative representation puts the emphasis on working with colour which Guerrero expresses through the use of new techniques derived from American Abstract Expressionism staining brushing and dripping rapid brushstrokes on large canvases These provide a new area of experimentation for his painting now freed of all previous artistic conventions and open to instinctive spontaneous expression Guerrero develops his own action painting and expression into which he incorporates memory landscape and culture Indications of this model of action and commitment to the canvas had already materialised by 1958

Fernando Zóbel has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1975.0 Signed Fernando Z bel lower left signed bel dated Mad 9 de Diciembre 75 titled La vista 40 and numbered 75 68 on the reverse The monochrome in Z bel stems from a struggle with the grid that manifests itself as a hint of a frame to contain the gesture or image of dispersed pigment What complicates this delicate poetics is its difficult if not impossible technique The artist experiments with the hypodermic needle which dispenses solvent and paint He reflects on it with irony stating I was using a hypodermic syringe which is one of the least expressive instruments possible The only advantage a hypodermic has is that it permits you to make an extremely long thin line in oil But it is very hard to get any beauty or expressivity out of it Here the tension between poiesis and techne surfaces in a very lively way and elaborates in the long term as a tension between the autonomy of the aesthetic and the ecology of the material To the degree that it frustrates both autographic labor and the automatism of instrument Z bel s response to the grid fulfills the promise of the self renewing modern Patrick Flores Memory of Qualities Z bel Chillida Criscrossing paths exh cat Mayoral Barcelona 2019 p 137

Doug Aitken has created a large expensive Sculpture on Mirror, high-density foam, MDF in the modern year of 2021.0 Working across photography sculpture multichannel video and immersive installation Doug Aitken illuminates the effects of our media saturated culture Using the landscape as both subject and medium he homes in on themes of industrial urban and environmental decline Aitken often employs seemingly straightforward yet provocative words and symbols to invoke themes relating to existentialism the American landscape and contemporary life Often he crafts these text and symbol based sculptures with dazzling mirrored surfaces allowing viewers to perceive themselves as if through a kaleidoscope refracted as scattered light across the room Star broken 2021 takes the form of a mirrored five pointed star calling to mind a series of associations a naval symbol the American Flag movie stars or a sign of merit Each of the star s points are counterchanged like a compass rose only instead of alternating between dark and light its reflective surface is by turns shattered and pristine a formal juxtaposition that implicitly acknowledges the positive and negative associations such a seemingly innocuous symbol might inspire

Allan McCollum has created a large expensive Sculpture on Enamel on cast Hydrostone in the classic year of 1982.0 Allan McCollum produces a surrogate of painting an empty signifier that stands in the place of social relations objectifying them in a displaced way as George Baker has astutely put it The surrogate fulfills the task of painting it facilitates aesthetic engagement and economic exchange produces discourse and takes up space on the wall It does all the things that a painting should do But it is not a painting It is a fraud a fake a stand in The Plaster Surrogates of which McCollum has made hundreds are plaster structures painted with enamel there is no frame and there is no canvas They are blank paintings cast from an absent original More information on Allan McCollum HERE

Nicholas Galanin has created a small nominal Photography on C-print mounted on Dibond, walnut frame in the modern year of 2021.0 For Nicholas Galanin memory and land are inevitably entwined The 45 foot letters of Never Forget reference the Hollywood sign which initially spelled out HOLLYWOODLAND and was erected to promote a whites only development Its timing coincided with a development in Palm Springs that also connected to the film industry Studio contracts limited actors travel contributing to the city s rise as playground and refuge of the stars Meanwhile the white settler mythology of America as the land of the free home of the brave was promoted in the West and the landscape was cinematized through the same lens Never Forget asks settler landowners to participate in the work by transferring land titles and management to local Indigenous communities The work is a call to action and a reminder that land acknowledgments become only performative when they do not explicitly support the land back movement Not only does the work transmit a shockwave of historical correction but also promises to do so globally through social media

Alex Hubbard has created a medium expensive Painting on Urethane and oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Alex Hubbard achieves his multimedia paintings through a process of layering nontraditional industrial materials like resin fiberglass pigmented urethane and auto body paint resulting in dense compositions that are both controlled and expressive In Casual Exposure 2021 for instance Hubbard combined traditional painting techniques and resin pouring with UV printing technology to overlay images of mechanical elements gas tanks hoses and decorative patterns Figurative and material elements alike appear to emerge and recede from the indeterminate crevices formed in the process While predominantly abstract the painting evokes the narrative traces of its making namely Hubbard s process of creation and destruction agency and chance 
Silke Otto-Knapp has created a medium nominal Painting on Watercolor on canvas in the modern year of 2019.0 Silke Otto Knapp employs her signature monochromatic watercolor painting technique to create evocative tableaux reminiscent of a stage where dancers bodies collapse into one another In a 2021 interview with curator Solveig vsteb she described her technique as follows By working with accumulation and removal of pigment at the same time I try to keep figure and ground in an active relationship to each other I start with a primed white surface and paint the motif using black watercolor The painting process involves a repetitive adding of pigment and its subsequent removal by spraying a fine film of water onto the painted surface Every positive mark is made with a view to what it s going to look like when I remove it I have always found it productive to work with restrictions and to concentrate on a few elements only Works by Silke Otto Knapp are currently on view in the 34th Sao Paulo Bienal 
Sarah Grilo has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1965.0 Born in Buenos Aires in 1917 Sarah Grilo began her early studies in painting with the renowned Spanish artist Vicente Puig Grilo lived in Argentina France and Spain before receiving a J S Guggenheim Fellowship in 1961 and subsequently moved to New York At her arrival in NY the Buenos Aires born artist felt the need to inject reality into her painting and the certainty that she felt she was in the right place at the right time to take the leap New York of the fifties had become the new hub of the international art scene and its streets were a creative haven for a generation of artists beckoned to push the limits of art In 1962 the same year that Grilo arrived in the city Warhol created his first screen print Oldenburg exhibited his soft sculptures Kusama surprised everyone with her accumulations and Judd blurred the notion of originality by creating objects that could be redone without losing their artistic condition Grilo would come to absorb the strategies and technical resources of the new avant garde from a stance of independence and creative freedom Her status as a female artist from abroad with limited command of the language fuelled in her the idea of translating and transposing reality to the picture plane through the discursive use of language Soon her canvases began to fill up with words signs and inscriptions that she found in adverts in Life Magazine in headlines in newspapers such as the New York Times and in the graffiti lining the walls of the city s buildings Words and numbers jumbled together and partially fragmented by glazes of paint turned each canvas into a collage of meaning and brand new connections that would create a talking point on the real effects of publicity and political discourse at the time as can be seen in At Macy s from 1965 Grilo left New York in 1970 and headed for Europe having amassed an extraordinary wealth of pictorial vocabulary Each painting hides resources and solutions that add up to a creative and vital universe that does not conform to any particular evolutionary or chronological style parameters They are works born from a deprived need for programmatic artifice seducing the spectator from their own pictorial condition Grilo has held both solo and group exhibitions at numerous galleries and institutions in the United States Latin America and Europe These include Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof a Madrid Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes Buenos Aires Museo de Bellas Artes Caracas Instituto de Arte Contempor neo Lima Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation CIFO Miami Art Museum of the Americas Washington D C Nelson Rockefeller Collection New York Blanton Museum of Art Austin Stedelijk Museum of Art Amsterdam or Museo Espa ol de Arte Contempor neo Madrid among others Most recently Grilo s work was shown at the Museum of Modern Art s MoMA groundbreaking 2017 exhibition Making Space Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction

David Hartt has created a large nominal Mixed Media on Tapestry in the modern year of 2021.0  Tapestry was something that allowed me to go larger as a means to deal with what I think of as the power and spectacle of history painting It has a particular kind of authority and also I love the way that history painting plays with different temporalities simultaneously As you approach the work the material itself started to reveal a whole new set of textures and qualities So in producing that tapestry it really opened up a whole range of options in terms of where I could eventually take the work in the future I was also really excited about the idea of re exploring the terrain that I thought was abandoned David HarttDavid Hartt s tapestry is based on the landscape paintings of Frederic Edwin Church 1826 1900 a central figure in the Hudson River School of American landscape painters More information on David Hartt HERE 
Idris Khan has created a medium cheap Painting on Gesso and oil stick on black and white fibre print mounted on aluminum panel in the modern year of 2019.0 Originally Quartet was a sixty part installation that has been presented at the 9m high Corner Space of Galerie Thomas Schulte in 2019 Mounted on aluminum and gesso panels Khan uses enlarged fiber printed pages of sheet music as the ground for this serial work of abstract oil stick paintings On each of the panels the notation itself has been blocked out by an impasto expressive application of black and blue oil paint and gesso leaving visible only very high and low musical notes dynamics and articulation marks The installation in its entirety took on a minimal presentation in form of a grid Installed in equal distance from one another the panels spread across the two nine meter high walls Music is often seen as an abstract representation of human emotions Notation systems are a further means of abstraction an attempt to translate and render the ephemeral time based sound replicable and conservable However like emotions the experience of music can neither be repeated nor relived Khan s Quartet eloquently speaks of this impossibility emphasizing the silence of the material while at the same time using it for a new creation a new composition with its own rhythm and expressiveness More information on Idris Khan HERE

Juan Uslé has created a medium nominal Painting on Vinyl dispersion and dry pigmenton canvas in the modern year of 2019.0 Juan Usl born 1954 in Santander Spain has developed a rich painterly oeuvre that operates in the space between pure abstraction and emotionally intense subjective expression Since the early 1980s he sought to create paintings informed on a meta narrative level by his personal experience while also reflecting the fundamental rules of his pictorial vocabulary To date his most comprehensive series of paintings called So que revelabas I dreamed that you revealed distils the poetic emotional conceptualism that permeates Usl s visual universe down to its essence the structural conditions of painting and the pictorial process Each brushstroke is both the indexical image of the painterly gesture and the direct physical representation of the artist s relationship to his work More information on Juan Usl HERE 
Michael Müller has created a medium nominal Painting on Acrylic and lacquer on Belgian linen and glass in the modern year of 2020.0  Vor und hinter dem Glas is the title of the first series of abstract paintings where Michael M ller uses a range of materials from glass canvas and metal as surfaces to paint on The artist explores possibilities of shaping the relationship between an image s projected spatial effects and its nature as a painting and three dimensional object By painting on glass which usually separates the painting from its surroundings we as viewers see the paint from behind through the transparent surface The composition of the final work which in some cases consists of several layers of paint on transparent and non transparent surfaces requires M ller to paint in reverse The mental blueprint of the work s final composition is painted backwards to forwards Moreover the paint seen from behind the glass appears as a smooth saturated surface The brushstroke the physical trace of the artist s hand traditionally central to the painterly process remains hidden concealed in the small space between the glass and the canvas or wall During the summer Michael M ller had a very successful show of his abstract paintings at the new private Kunsthalle of collector Heiner Wemh ner in Berlin For 2022 the artist is preparing two solo shows in Germany namely for the Staedel Museum in Frankfurt and the Museum im Kulturspeicher in W rzburg Michael M ller born 1970 in Ingelheim am Rhein Germany is a conceptual artist whose manifold proliferating oeuvre resists any straightforward or one way interpretation M ller continuously broadens the methods of his artistic expression combining works on paper with painting text based work sculpture found objects music and performance and has even developed a cosmetic line and fashion collection He received great critical and curatorial attention for his Eighteen Exhibitions cycle which resulted in solo exhibitions at two of Germany s most progressive art institutions KW Institute of Contemporary Art Berlin and Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden Baden More information on Michael M ller HERE

Jonathan Lasker has created a small cheap Painting on Oil and  pigment pen on paper in the classic year of 2005.0 Jonathan Lasker born 1948 in Jersey City NJ is a painter whose constantly growing oeuvre simultaneously manifests the vitality as well as the validity of contemporary painting and is considered as pioneering in this regard by younger generations In response to the lyrical abstraction color field painting and minimalism of the US of the 1970s Lasker felt that painting was confronted with the challenge of artistic reinvention and set about to develop his self referential system of sign like forms and colors which he still varies and reformulates today While Lasker mostly works with large scale formats he also explores smaller compositions Lasker s paintings are the result of conceptual planning whilst simultaneously making the dynamics of the process of gestation explicit His paintings remain vexing the viewer senses that even though the sign like forms derive from spontaneous gestural movements of the hand they have nevertheless been applied to the canvas in a controlled and deliberate manner From this initially diffuse discomfort of the viewer confronted with the concentrated energy of this frozen spontaneity there may result the provocative power of Lasker s paintings Hans Michael Herzog Jonathan Lasker studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York City between 1975 and 1977 and at the California Institute of the Arts in 1977 In 2000 he was appointed Honorary Visiting Professor at The London Institute Notable solo exhibitions include shows at the Mus e d art moderne et contemporain Saint tienne 2015 K20 Kunstsammlung Nordrhein Westfalen and Museo Reina Sof a 2003 the Kunsthalle Bielefeld 1997 98 and the Stedelijk Museum 1998 Selected group exhibitions include the Neue Galerie in Kassel 2011 12 Pinakothek der Moderne 2009 MUDAM Luxembourg 2008 Centre Georges Pompidou 2007 la Caixa Foundation in Barcelona 2002 Mus e d art moderne et contemporain St tienne 1997 Hayward Gallery 1994 Documenta 1992 and MoMA P S 1 1992 His work is included in the collections of the Birmingham Museum of Art The British Library the Corcoran Gallery of Art Washington D C Daros Collection Fond National d Art Contemporain la Caixa Foundation LACMA Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden MIT List Center for the Visual Arts Moderna Museet Museo Reina Sof a Museum Ludwig Cologne New York Public Library Sammlung Goetz Munich and the Whitney Museum of American Art Jonathan Lasker lives and works in New York City More information on Jonathan Lasker HERE 
Jonathan Lasker has created a small cheap Painting on Oil on paper in the classic year of 2016.0 Jonathan Lasker born 1948 in Jersey City NJ is a painter whose constantly growing oeuvre simultaneously manifests the vitality as well as the validity of contemporary painting and is considered as pioneering in this regard by younger generations In response to the lyrical abstraction color field painting and minimalism of the US of the 1970s Lasker felt that painting was confronted with the challenge of artistic reinvention and set about to develop his self referential system of sign like forms and colors which he still varies and reformulates today While Lasker mostly works with large scale formats he also explores smaller compositions His small maquettes allow for precise attention to detail which the artist subsequently reproduces in his large scale paintings Thus Lasker turns the organic subjective and gestural pictorial idiom of painting into an increasingly intellectual process Lasker s paintings are colorful and precisely executed compositions which bring together unconventional forms and color combinations that question the traditional perception of foreground and background and the relationship between surface and figure Jonathan Lasker studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York City between 1975 and 1977 and at the California Institute of the Arts in 1977 In 2000 he was appointed Honorary Visiting Professor at The London Institute Notable solo exhibitions include shows at the Mus e d art moderne et contemporain Saint tienne 2015 K20 Kunstsammlung Nordrhein Westfalen and Museo Reina Sof a 2003 the Kunsthalle Bielefeld 1997 98 and the Stedelijk Museum 1998 Selected group exhibitions include the Neue Galerie in Kassel 2011 12 Pinakothek der Moderne 2009 MUDAM Luxembourg 2008 Centre Georges Pompidou 2007 la Caixa Foundation in Barcelona 2002 Mus e d art moderne et contemporain St tienne 1997 Hayward Gallery 1994 Documenta 1992 and MoMA P S 1 1992 His work is included in the collections of the Birmingham Museum of Art The British Library the Corcoran Gallery of Art Washington D C Daros Collection Fond National d Art Contemporain la Caixa Foundation LACMA Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden MIT List Center for the Visual Arts Moderna Museet Museo Reina Sof a Museum Ludwig Cologne New York Public Library Sammlung Goetz Munich and the Whitney Museum of American Art Jonathan Lasker lives and works in New York City More information on Jonathan Lasker HERE 
Pat Steir has created a large expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 2012.0 Thanks to the signature drip style of her paintings Pat Steir born 1940 in Newark NJ since the 1980s has been at the forefront of American painting In her works the paint itself paints the painting relaying to the beholder the deep physicality of time the workings of gravity and the exigencies of chance Art historian Doris von Drathen writes In contrast to the Action Painting of someone like Jackson Pollock who did his pourings on the ground Pat Steir works with canvasses leaning against the wall and by building an elaborate complexity of layerings she creates pictorial spaces whose meditative silence is reminiscent of Agnes Martin The consummate art of Pat Steir lies in the delicately equilibrated interplay between the force of gravity and the properties of the paint for its quantity consistency and substance determine the fragile oscillation between deliberate control and chance occurrence Thus Pat Steir works as she herself says with the nature of painting Pat Steir s work is included in major public collections around the world including the Metropolitan Museum of Art MoMA the National Gallery of Art Washington D C SFMOMA the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum the Tate and the Whitney Museum of American Art More information on Pat Steir HERE

Rosha Yaghmai has created a small nominal Mixed Media on Acrylic and ink on organza and cotton in the modern year of 2021.0 Afterimages continues Yaghmai s exploration of the potential for the psychedelic inhabiting other remote spaces times and dimensions Her multifaceted work seeks to unearth hidden histories and esoteric knowledge ingrained in the genetic material of the body In this latest group of works Yaghmai has turned to autobiographical material Informed by the fantastic landscapes of the Persian miniatures on view in her childhood home Yaghmai explores the dissembling of myth and history as they are represented in these works of art Her dark luminescent afterimages obscure and abstract the miniature in order to investigate the processes of distortion estrangement and assimilation of inheritance In Afterimages Yaghmai removes the historical figures from her source material abstracting and zooming in on the landscapes of the miniatures Through this process the work favors distortion over representation The original connotations of the miniature are obscured and the viewer is provided a fresh space for contemplation and can now find new meaning in the compositions Invoking the aesthetics of lenticular prints Yaghmai layers painted organza to create depth and moir patterns within the enhanced scenes When viewed from different angles the work begins to shift across the compositional plane The viewer cannot focus on one image but is left instead with an impression of a vivid sensation within the eye In these afterimages Yaghmai creates an entirely new interior landscape at once familiar and foreign

Mary Sibande has created a large expensive Sculpture on Fiberglass, resin, fabric, and steel on painted wood plinth in the classic year of 2016.0 In this work we see Sophie Mary Sibande s avatar stepping up onto a pedestal She is in her purple phase representative of the spirit of constructive resistance encapsulated by the Purple Rain protests in South Africa during which authorities sprayed protestors with purple ink from water cannons intent on marking them so they could be arrested later Purple is also a vague reference to clergy and royalty two authoritarian forces in colonial Africa but also two two roles that would never have been afforded Sophie in times past Here she is adorned in her purple garb ascending with dignity into her new role Beneath her purple clothing we can already see hints of her next phase the red phase Color is fundamental aspect of Sibande s practice She was born Black in Johannesburg South Africa in 1982 part of the majority yet oppressed by the institutionally white supremacist Apartheid system which granted minority whites supreme political control Sibande s mother was a domestic worker her uniform a standard blue dress with white lace apron and head scarf Her father dressed in green fatigues served in the South African Army When she was just seven years old Sibande watched as the police turned water cannons filled with purple dye onto anti apartheid protestors days before national elections The purple dye was intended to make protesters easier to arrest and indeed hundreds were rounded up and jailed yet protestors commandeered one of the cannons and turned it on the governing party s legislative offices After the riot graffiti around the city foretold The purple shall govern Six years later Apartheid would officially end but still today racial inequity is rampant in South Africa Sibande expresses the frustration of contemporary Black South Africans with the color red a choice stemming from the Zulu aphorism ie ukwatile uphenduke inja ebomvu meaning he is angry he turned into a red dog Sibande employs the human form as a vehicle through photography and sculpture as a focused critique on the stereotypical depictions of women particularly black women in South Africa The body for Sibande and particularly how we clothe it is the site where this history is contested and where Sibande s own fantasies can play out This counter history takes the form of an alter ego in Sibande s early work a persona by the name of Sophie who is dressed in various uniforms that resemble the dresses worn by domestic workers Altering these dress styles into Victorian motifs Sibande completely reanimates Sophie s history through how her body is adorned and the way she occupies these narratives that were stolen and denied from her Transitioning from blue to green to purple to red Sibande introduces us not only to the many faces of herself and Sophie but to the complex person hoods of African Women who continue to create worlds and narratives outside of the canon of Western Imperialism

Anthony Hernandez has created a medium nominal Photography on Inkjet print in the classic year of 2018.0 Screened Pictures consists of portraits of Los Angeles as seen through the metal mesh of the various different bus stops throughout the city The scenes are abstracted and offer a different perspective of the city than his earlier works giving off a digital appearance even though they are all taken on film and have not been digitally manipulated Screened Pictures brings forth a shift back to figures in Hernandez s photographs as well Different from his earlier series his figures are now blurred through the inherent abstraction of the metal grating and his choice to focus the camera consistently on the metal mesh rather than the background Upon closer examination of the photographs visual cues inform the viewer as to what they could be looking at a tent perched on the edge of a patch of grass a lone figure walking in front of a gas station and various different architectural details from throughout the city All of these bring to mind certain aspects of Hernandez s other series yet this revisitation is from a completely different perspective LA is my big studio Hernandez has said One day I m in one corner the next in the middle it s like having a filter to see LA in a new way Anthony Hernandez first began photographing in 1966 with a 35mm camera His early works consisted of black and white street photography that were solemn and pensive After receiving a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts Hernandez purchased a large format camera and began photographing urban landscapes and public spaces He then made his first color work Rodeo Drive 1984 photographing shoppers with a 35mm camera on the famed street in Beverly Hills for which the series is named His later series would differ greatly as he shifted away from photographing figures that were central to the image itself rather focusing on the spaces that they inhabited and the scenes that followed Within each body of work Hernandez acknowledges the implied cultural differences of class and race that is inherent to the city Hernandez s subject matter is born out of Los Angeles itself a documentation of the common places that are accessible to all but also seldom used Los Angeles is a city of erasure and through his photographs Hernandez is able to capture a persistent feeling of loss His pictures are often devoid of figural representation yet rampant with their lingering presence The minimal and mindful framing of each image made Hernandez s photographs as charged as tarot cards according to critic Luc Sante His photographing of public transit areas is one that he has returned to often first in his series Public Use Areas 1980 and now again in Screened Pictures 2017 2018

Evan Nesbit has created a small cheap Painting on Acrylic, ink, dye and burlap in the modern year of 2021.0 Evan Nesbit s paintings are formal inversions that visually develop as both an image and model of the provisional space in which the artist works A kind of syntactical abstraction develops as a result of the chance operations of his process following the margins along which semblance swings to reveal visual uncertainty Thus his images are never fixed but are constantly transforming long after the paint has dried Even the titles he gives his paintings Fargazer Bedlock Echoland suggest a constant effortless transformation and the idea that systems of understanding are unreliable at best It is this very unreliability that holds his attention Evan Nesbit s b 1985 based in Nevada City CA paintings expand his process of rendering space and depth through illusionistic visual cues forming works inserted between the boundaries of experience and reality Nesbit uses pattern color and material relationships to challenge the pictorial space of painting s modes of perception For the artist painting is an attempt through material and process to capture space and light in estranged recognition The artist s new work continues this interest in material based abstraction and concepts of perceptual psychology with an expanded color palette and tight compositions His paintings are made by manipulating acrylic paint through the warp and weft of burlap textiles to create works that fold textured paint surfaces within the woven structure of the substrate to capture a kind of performative gesture in the making of each piece The burlap is often dyed in pieces and sewn together to make the complete canvas for the work Evan starts his paintings by selecting burlap a found object which he then treats and hand dyes Smaller pieces are often one piece of burlap canvas larger canvases may contain multiple pieces hand sewn together to form one surface Evan then pushes acrylic paint through the weave of the burlap the result is a sculptural surface where the paint takes on its final form While the process is itself controlled the end result is subject to chance or randomness at times the paint barely comes through the fabric other times it beads on the surface forming sculptural shapes Nesbit received his MFA from Yale University New Haven CT In 2012 he received the Ely Harwood Schless Memorial Fund Prize from Yale University

Willie Birch has created a medium nominal Work on Paper on Charcoal and acrylic on paper in the classic year of 2013.0 Birch was first recognized for his own papier mach sculptures that depicted African American men women and children engaged in common activities and rituals In the late 1980 s Birch returned to New Orleans from New York City where he was living to attend the World Fair and visited the iconic Saint Louis Cathedral Catholic church While there he came upon a classical figurative sculpture from 15th century Spain depicting a crucifixion created in papier mach This experience was monumental for Birch It was the catalyst for connecting metaphorical and symbolic interpretation in his artistic practice It opened up the ideas of how art is conveyed in terms of its fragility preciousness the value in our society and the art world Since the papier mach series all the works Birch has created are an extension of his living experiences Each series is an accumulation that speaks to the human conditions he chronicles in daily occurrences Birch s recent works privilege the everyday object He records the anti moments coiled hoses wildflowers tennis shoes a cat on a porch all situated in the historically Black and working class neighborhoods Birch s works are narrative autobiographical and a document of his encounters Beginning in 2000 Birch removed all color from his palette working only in black and white These graphic paintings made from acrylic and charcoal stem from the artist s observations of the people and landscape of New Orleans and Louisiana Birch uses a distinct layering of transparencies and mark making that is meant to act as a metaphor for human connection Each layer holds a deeper meaning that when peeled away reveals the universal meaning of connectiveness These works are no more representational than abstract They are reflections of Birch s feelings on the meaning of humanity

Betye Saar has created a medium expensive Sculpture on Etched steel in the classic year of 1996.0 Betye Saar s Diaspora s Spirit 1996 one of three Spirit Chairs commissioned for the 1996 Olympic Arts Festival in Atlanta refers to the legacy of Africa wherever its people have migrated The steel surface is etched with the configuration of the interior of a slave ship I am a mixed media assemblage artist Much of my art is concerned with the recycling of ordinary objects and the transformation of them into objects with a ritual like presence In some areas of Africa it is the custom to place chairs in the bush to provide the spirits a place to rest a seat of the spirit These three chairs spirit chairs were designed for three different temporary sites in Atlanta Georgia This installation is dedicated to the spirit of the diaspora and to all who have migrated from other places to make a new home Betye Saar 1996 I began to become more interested in symbols that directly related to Africa and maybe South East Asia I participated in an event called Festac in Nigeria During the day when there were no activities we wanted to do we would go on field trips to different villages and things like that and I would find things One of them was a deportation place where the slaves were brought and then they would jump into the boat and sail away So I had visually experienced that and that was a deep interest to me Then it seemed to sort of merge into like the liberation series and the series of using derogatory images Slaves were held underneath this building in chains and then the ships came in There was a smaller ship that took them out to a larger ship at sea There are two places that I have seen this In Nigeria and the second place was to Senegal where there was just a window and a 20 foot drop Where slaves were marched to this stone window where they jumped off and had to swim to save their lives to get to the ship that would take them to the larger ship So those were two personal experiences of seeing that Visually the diagram of the slave ship is very interesting to me this sort of elongated oval with all the bodies chained to each other with the children in the center The men on one side the women on the other side So that has become a real example of my visual language in creating art of using the slave ship This is a story this is where it starts maybe from a tribal activity or African sculpture to the Diaspora slave ship to wherever they left the ship you know in the Caribbean in Brazil the United States And then what they had to become when they were there when they were like Aunt Jemima and all those things and then Aunt Jemima to what you know Betye Saar interview with the Visionary Project 2010As one of the artists who ushered in the development of Assemblage art Betye Saar s practice reflects on African American identity spirituality and the connectedness between different cultures Her symbolically rich body of work has evolved over time to demonstrate the environmental cultural political racial technological economic and historical context in which it exists For over six decades Saar has created assemblage works that explore the social political and economic underpinnings of America s collective memory She began her career at the age of 35 producing work that dealt with mysticism nature and family Saar s art became political in the 1970 s namely with the assemblage The Liberation of Aunt Jemima in 1972 As did many of the women who came to consciousness in the 1960 s Saar takes on the feminist mantra the personal is political as a fundamental principle in her assemblage works Her appropriation of black collectibles heirlooms and utilitarian objects are transformed through subversion and yet given her status as a pioneer of the Assemblage movement the impact of Saar s oeuvre on contemporary art has yet to be fully acknowledged or critically assessed Among the older generation of Black American artists Saar is without reproach and continues to both actively produce work and inspire countless others

Christian Eisenberger has created a large cheap Painting on acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Christian EisenbergerChristian Eisenberger was born in 1978 he lives and works in Vienna His painterly oeuvre is in many respects exceptional on many counts first and foremost conceptually but also aesthetically Eisenberger has always considered himself more of an artist than a painter For quite a long time he used painting the supreme creative discipline in the arts only sporadically since he harboured such strong reservations towards this genre at the beginning of his career Yet his handling of colour has always been marked by an amazing confidence His very early works among them the widely known numbered cardboard boxes with portraits of famous figures already stood out because of his individual style which is quite remarkable considering the artist s young age when he created them Even if the artist gravitated in the following years towards other artistic genres like street or land art he never entirely gave up painting in spite of his completely breaking with it at times Although the artist is undoubtedly fully aware of the history of painting his work appears to develop completely independent of the often self reflective painting discourse of recent decades Conceptual questions concerning the medium do not play a major role he rather playfully explores form color and composition From this point of view his work can by all means be described as classical The paintings presented in the current exhibition have seemingly emerged from within themselves in a very short span of time and impress the viewer once more through their formal expertise and clarity At the same time his pieces immediately function as a picture at first glance Although he uses elements that are already familiar in his work such as the adhesive tape they have been reworked and composed here in an unprecedented way Interestingly the non painter Eisenberger has once again created a series of works that is exciting and unique in the context of contemporary painting Dr Markus Gugatschka Christian Eisenberger is one of the most important Austrian artists of his generation The solo show SEHN SIE TIEF 9975 15432 32718 at Galerie Krinzinger Vienna was opened on November 5 2020 An important museum exhibition was just opened at Kunsthalle Gie en in Germany a big catalogue is in preparation His works are part of important institutional collections in Austria and internationally Germany Switzerland USA Taiwan Lithuania France Netherlands Portugal a o Most important solo exhibitions by Christian Eisenberger took place at the following institutions Kunsthalle Krems Krems AT 2008 K nstlerhaus Wien Vienna AT 2009 K nstlerhaus Graz Graz AT 2014 and Kunsthalle Gie en Gie en GER 2020 His works have also been featured in the following group shows Grenzkunst Halle Jennersdorf AT Museum Tinguely Basel CH Mumok Vienna AT Salon Dahlmann Berleri AT Kunsthalle Vienna AT Leopold Museum Vienna AT MUSA Wien AT Forum Frohner Krems AT Lentos Linz AT Forum Stadtpark Graz AT neue Galerie Graz AT
Brigitte Kowanz has created a large nominal Sculpture on neon, reflecting textile, aluminium in the modern year of 2021.0 Brigitte Kowanz born in Vienna in 1957 lives and works in Vienna Austria Since the 1980s light has been central in Brigitte Kowanz s work as an artistic medium which she explores in relation to space and in combination with signs codes and language She focusses on addressing visibility perception and the production of meaning all of this in the tradition of a critical reflection of the media In her latest pieces her interest has turned more to the digital revolutions of recent decades and their repercussions on society and on our perception of space Brigitte Kowanz developed her own artistic vocabulary of light over the course of more than three decades of artistic work Vocabulary is meant literally here to the extent that Brigitte Kowanz deploys light as language as code She employs pure light as an autonomous media just as in former times the painters worked with pure colour One important aspect of her light art is the use of language deriving from the experience of urban spaces and the ideography of Conceptual Art Her work for the Austrian Pavilion at the 57th International Art Exhibition La Biennale di Venezia represents the culmination of her vocabulary the use of neon light mirrors reflective metals writing codes and information Kowanz is a poet and architect of light Her light space at the Venice Biennale 2017 presented the interlocking of physical material space and immaterial virtual space The body is situated in real space The space was simultaneously expanded for the body into a virtual space by means of mirrors two way mirrors artificial light and so forth The words conduct the visitor in a conceptual space in a fictional space in a mental space She models or references the Internet s global data space Allegory is formally based to Brigitte Kowanz s handwriting The words multiplicated seemingly endlessly via the convex mirrors Since the 1980s Brigitte Kowanz is combining light and language to unique compositions Brigitte Kowanz has held the professorship for Transmedia Art at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna since 1997 In 2009 she was awarded the Great Austrian State Prize for Fine Arts and in 2018 the German Light Art Prize For her installation United in Diversity for the 13th Cairo Biennale she was awarded the Biennale Price 2019 In 1984 and 1995 she was represented at the Venice Biennale in 1987 at the S o Paulo Biennale and in 1990 at the Sydney Biennale In 2017 Brigitte Kowanz created the installation Infinity and Beyond for the Austrian Pavilion during the 57th Venice Biennale 
Jonathan Meese has created a large nominal Painting on acrylic and caparol dispersion binder on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Jonathan Meese was born 1970 in Tokyo Japan he lives and works in Berlin Germany His performances are often provocative and playful at first site and accompany his immense oeuvre of paintings sculptures and drawings Meese sees himself as soldier of art as someone who serves a free intellectual and aesthetic space he reveals the possibilities of poetry and lyricism Prominent figures from history and pop culture are leitmotifs in his oeuvre The superordinate claim in his image text productions is not immediately clear to everybody Meese frequently brings his own face and body the heroes of his youth and even his won mother into play and lining himself with historic figures What easily might be mistaken as the display of an inner pandemonium has nothing to do with narcissism Meese is not interested in Meese himself Rather with a playful devotion he calls the dictatorship of art beyond rules and ideologies Jonathan Meese s work has been shown in numerous solo and group shows such as Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt a M 2004 Statens Museum for Kunst Copenhagen 2005 Deichtorhallen Hamburg 2006 Museum of Contemporary Art Miami 2010 Akademie der Bildenden K nste Austria 2012 Museum der Moderne Salzburg 2013 Nationalgalerie Prague 2015 Carr Sainte Anne Montpellier 2017 Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna 2018 Pinakothek der Moderne Munich Germany 2018 Kunsthalle St Annen Overbeck Gesellschaft L beck 2019 Espoo Museum of Modern Art Espoo Finland 2019 DIE DR MABUSENLOLITA ZWISCHEN ABSTRAKTION UND WAHN Galerie Krinzinger Vienna 2021 His performances and lectures have been presented at Nationalgalerie Prag 2015 Volksb hne Berlin Deutsche Oper Berlin 2015 Irish Museum of Modern Art Dublin 2016 Wiener Festwochen Parsifal 2017 Lolita R evolution Rufsch digendst Ihr Alle seid die Lolita Eurer Selbst Schauspielhaus Theater Dortmund thetre production KAMPF L O L I T A EVOLUTION IST CHEF oder L O L I T A D Z I O ZARDOZ FLIEGT WIEDER Volkstheater Vienna Austria 2021 
Sarah Grilo has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1970.0 Born in Buenos Aires in 1917 Sarah Grilo began her early studies in painting with the renowned Spanish artist Vicente Puig Grilo lived in Argentina France and Spain before receiving a J S Guggenheim Fellowship in 1961 and subsequently moved to New York In 1970 the artist left for the south of Spain where she would stay until 1979 with her husband the artist Jos Antonio Fern ndez Muro and their children From 1980 she alternated her stay between Paris and Madrid where she definitely moved to live with her husband in 1985 until her death in 2007 In 1952 Grilo formed part of the Grupo de Artistas Modernos de la Argentina assembled by Aldo Pellegrini which included the artists Enio Iommi Tom s Maldonado Alfredo Hlito Lidy Prati Jos Antonio Fern ndez Muro among others The group had exhibitions at the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro and at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam In 1956 Grilo was part of the envoy to the Venice Biennial In the United States her work evolved from an initial post cubist figuration to geometrical abstraction By merging elements of abstract expressionism and an amalgamation of language symbols and scribbles Grilo created an energetic painting style in the early 1960s that anticipates the street art of graffiti artists such as Jean Michel Basquiat Following her time in New York Grilo s output evolved towards works characterized by their free gestuality in which the figures are replaced by numerical and textual signs that recreate torn posters and urban graffiti with enormous delicacy and visual awareness Grilo has held both solo and group exhibitions at numerous galleries and institutions in the United States Latin America and Europe These include Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof a Madrid Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes Buenos Aires Museo de Bellas Artes Caracas Instituto de Arte Contempor neo Lima Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation CIFO Miami Art Museum of the Americas Washington D C Nelson Rockefeller Collection New York Blanton Museum of Art Austin Stedelijk Museum of Art Amsterdam or Museo Espa ol de Arte Contempor neo Madrid among others Most recently Grilo s work was shown at the Museum of Modern Art s MoMA groundbreaking 2017 exhibition Making Space Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction 
Kirsi Mikkola has created a large nominal Painting on Acrylic and oil stick on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Finnish artist Kirsi Mikkola 1959 belongs to a generation of female artists who began their careers during the 1990s This generation includes painters like Charline von Heyl Michaela Eichwald Amelie von Wulffen to just name a few who all have in common that although extremely talented and reasonably successful they were held back from the limelight of the time by a strong male undercurrent that diminished their visibility and kept the main gates closed for them Only in the last couple of years we see a changing environment in which these female artists receive the acknowledgement that they deserve Mikkola keeps up with an abstract and even stronger male connoted tradition from Kirkeby to Oehlen that she meets with an extremely creative mindset of subversive depression and a palette that ranges between colorful and dark 
Tomie Ohtake has created a large expensive Painting on acrylic paint on canvas in the classic year of 1978.0 One of the main representatives of abstract art in Brazil Tomie Ohtake was born in Kyoto in 1913 and moved to Brazil in 1936 Her career as an artist began at the age of 37 when she became a member of the Seibi group which brought together artists of Japanese descent In the late 1950s when she left behind an initial phase of figurative studies in painting she immersed herself in abstract explorations During this time she performed a series of paintings which became known as blind paintings where she would blindfold herself during her process challenging the fundamental ideas of the Brazilian Neo concrete movement and bringing sensibility and intuition to the fore of her practice In the 1980s Tomie Ohtake began creating compositions where she painted circular shapes on square canvases The curves embedded the works with significant dynamism and offered geometrical balance In 1983 she introduced the use of acrylic paint which she dissolved in water before using allowing for a certain degree of chance and of her relinquishing control over the process of color layering The liquid quality of the material allowed the paint to follow its own suit flowing into different directions and creating cloud like shapes After allowing the colors to spread on the surface she intervened with a paintbrush to introduce her own composition onto the canvas By the end of the decade her intervention and gesture became increasingly significant yet she convened a sense of transparency and depth to her brushstrokes always leaving the color fields uncompromised 
Manoela Medeiros has created a large   Painting on painting and excavation on canvas in the modern year of 2020.0 In her practice Medeiros articulates an approach to painting that transcends the specificities of the medium making use of sculpture performance and installation work Pursuing a hybrid framework for the pictorial Medeiros questions artistic media by going beyond their conventional formats producing paintings and in situ installations that explore the relationships between space time and the corporeality of art and of the viewer The artist frequently performs direct interventions into exhibition spaces creating works that emerge from the singularities of the space around her whether they be material structural or in relation to natural and artificial light With this her practice attributes a sense of organicity to space turning architecture into its own body one that is specific to the experience of art Through a seemingly archeological process Medeiros engages with the notion of ruins as a spatial indication for passing time undertaking a process that reveals what is often left to underlie The artist scrapes surfaces such as the exhibition space s walls unveiling the layers of colors and materials employed covered and thus forgotten over time Medeiros seeks to reinvigorate our temporal experience by exhibiting layers each of which carries the memory of the time when it was created and by allowing them to coexist and intertwine Thus the artist operates within a liminal space between construction and destruction foregrounding how they may complement rather than detract from each other 
Daniel Buren has created a medium expensive Installation on mirror, black vinyl adhesive, mdf and white acrylic paint in the modern year of 2021.0 Daniel Buren has been a leading name in conceptual art since the 1960s as a founding member of the Buren Mosset Parmentier Toroni association which he remains part of until today He is best known for his use of contrasting white and colored symmetrical stripes which he alternates and places onto visual surfaces and architectural spaces often working with historical landmarks Between 1967 and 1968 Buren began producing unsolicited public artworks using awning canvases commonly found in France setting up hundreds of striped posters around Paris Later on between 1970 and 1973 he resumed this activity and installed his works in over one hundred underground stations of the Paris Metro quickly drawing significant public attention to these unauthorized urban interventions Buren is known for having introduced the notion of in situ in visual arts as a term characterizing an artistic practice that intrinsically binds works to the topological and cultural specificities of the place they are designed to occupy Indeed early on in his career Buren focused on the rising influence of architecture particularly museum architecture on art As a result he centered his production on three dimensional works that functioned as modulations of space rather than as objects His pieces quickly evolved to become sites in and of themselves instilling their own space for movement in and around them In the 1990s the artist moved away from merely applying color to walls and instead turned to literally install it in space in the form of filters and colored sheets of glass or plexiglass With this the works seem to explode into one s space a sensation that Buren intensifies through the use of mirrors inviting the viewer to engage with the work by making use of their entire body Buren challenges conventional notions of where art can be seen or experienced and how it can be understood Recently his investigations have evolved into using light as a means of producing macro scale color effects and mirrors to alter space through image refraction His work has been widely exhibited internationally notably participating in iconic presentations such as over a dozen editions of the Venice Biennale for which he was awarded Best Pavilion receiving the Golden Lion 
Cristina Canale has created a large nominal Painting on oil paint on cotton in the modern year of 2020.0 Cristina Canale rose to prominence following her participation in the iconic group exhibition Como vai voc Gera o 80 at Escola de Artes Visuais do Parque Lage EAV Parque Lage in Rio de Janeiro in 1984 Like many of her colleagues from the so called Generation 80 her early works reveal the influence of the international context as painting resurfaced especially with that of German Neo expressionism Loaded with visual elements and thick paint her early paintings have a material or textural characteristic that is reinforced by her use of contrasting and vivid colors In the early 1990s Canale moved to Germany to study in D sseldorf under the guidance of the Dutch conceptual artist Jan Dibbets Her compositions soon acquired a sense of spatiality as she began to incorporate the use of planes and depth while also adding greater fluidity to her use of colors Cristina Canale s work is often based on prosaic everyday scenes which she extracts from advertising photography Her paintings result in elaborate compositions that intertwine the figurative and the abstract often blurring one with the other According to the curator Tiago Mesquita Canale s production opposes the quest for constituting structures of the image which artists such as Gerhard Richter and Robert Ryman engage with tackling instead the image and established genres of painting in a subjective manner following the belief in a singular experience 
Daniel Senise has created a large nominal Painting on monotype of wall on fabric and acrylic medium on aluminum in the modern year of 2021.0 Daniel Senise is one of the leading representatives of Brazil s so called Generation 80s whose main endeavour consisted of a desire to return to and reinsert painting into the Brazilian artistic scene Since the end of the 1990s Senise s practice can be described as a construction of images His process begins with imprinting the textures of surfaces such as wooden floors or concrete walls from carefully chosen locations unto textiles similar to the monotype technique Once ready this material becomes the base or skeleton of his work either as a canvas to be worked on as parts used in a collage to create another image or alternatively as fragments added on to printed photographs Senise s investigations often relate to the memory of places and spaces Not only will his works figuratively represent specific locations but he also uses objects found in those specific places such as broken ceramics pieces of wood dust or wall chippings He therefore intertwines the representation of a site with its debris or in other words its history he juxtaposes time memory and the physical presence which stems from them 
Kenneth Young has created a small expensive Painting on Acrylic on canvas in the classic year of 1968.0  
Guillaume Bijl has created a large nominal Installation on Mixed Media in the classic year of 2015.0  My Compositions are a logical consequence of the way in which I manipulate themes and materials in my larger installations These Compositions however are devoid of all situational pretensions I myself would describe the relationship in my uvre between the compositions and installations as follows If I were to interpret my larger installations as large tableaux my compositions would relate to them as sketches or small drawings In general I wish to regard them as a present day archeological still life GB Bijl the euro weirdo existing on the fringe of artworld purview Probably in need of a retrospective Bijl is the missing link between Broodthaers display tact as object creedence lent and today s culturo marxist surrealists Sign detached ever so slightly from its signified like wearing a mask of its own face Tableau in which the performers perform themselves And question of How could I ever possibly be not be myself Is the Scrooge McDuck staring into you still the Scrooge McDuck when he is set into the alternate blank white universe where he acts only as a referent sign to himself or was he always only a referent to himself Quoted from Guillaume Bijl at Nagel Draxler Contemporary Art Writing Daily April 2016 source artwritingdaily com 
Brian Calvin has created a small nominal Painting on Acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0  
Franco Grignani has created a medium nominal Mixed Media on Mixed media on Schoeller cardboard on masonite in the classic year of 1962.0  What scares me is the obvious the banality the already done the nonsense Franco Grignani Franco Grignani 1908 1999 an Italian artist and graphic designer was a major exponent of Op Art Born in 1908 in Pieve Porto Morone Pavia he was undoubtedly one of the most profound innovators of the twentieth century His multifaceted figure has moved throughout his career on the fine line that binds art design and graphics Indeed in addition to being an experimental and abstract artist Grignani is famous for his works as a graphic designer in collaboration with important Italian companies such as Pirelli and the printer Alfieri Lacroix with whom he began a very long and fruitful partnership in the 1950s Grignani s creative drive has its roots in the experience of the Bauhaus and its authoritative exponents including Moholy Nagy Feininger Peterhans and Gropius Right from the start his personal research on the dynamism and representation of movement close to the ideas of futurism and photodynamics led him to reflect on the importance of vision and the need for the viewer s involvement in the work His ability to see beyond to be able to analyse all emotional phenomena at the presentation of an image has made him an exemplary visual researcher conducting a mental process aimed at investigating infinite possibilities of meaning From multiple vision to distortions to geometric games focus and blur to reflective surfaces all of Grignani s works offer us a reality different from the normal one they are self referential and put us in a sort of short circuit of perception that produces anxiety and tension His works are part of the collections of the MoMA in New York the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London The work Campo fenomenico con accoppiamento di due trame matematiche 1962 masterfully exemplifies his continuous exchange between artistic research and visual communication with leaps forward and recoveries of past experiences making it clear what he meant when he said I don t seek I find Here the artist works for structures of wholes configurable in parallel segmentations which interrupt and intersect forming compact visual masses that act on our senses as so many organised stimuli 
Lucio Fontana has created a small expensive Painting on Waterpaint on canvas in the classic year of 1965.0  I do not want to make a painting I want to open up space create a new dimension tie in the cosmos as it endlessly expands beyond the confining plane of the picture Lucio FontanaBorn in Argentina to Italian parents Lucio Fontana 1899 1968 is acclaimed as one of the most important post war artists As the founder of Spatialism his legacy has been immensely influential to generations of artists to follow His groundbreaking manifesto the White Manifesto focused on the spatial qualities of the artwork subverting the traditional two dimensionality of the painting Best known for his tagli cuts and buchi holes Fontana violently slashed the canvas leaving distinctive slashed or pierced marks on the surface of his monochrome works This innovative gesture made him one of the first European artists to bridge his art making practice with a performative act Fontana s Concetto Spaziale Attese 1965 1966 is an extraordinary example of Fontana s most groundbreaking body of work Four dramatic slashes cut through the artist s vibrant yellow tableau The inscription on the retro of the canvas reads venuto a trovarmi Maria Ghiringelli Maria Ghiringelli came to visit me and refers to Maria Ghiringhelli whose family owned the Galleria del Milione in Milan in its early days Charged with connotative energy the canvas radiates in possession of Fontana s search of the infinite amplified by the contrasting presence of the black verso of the painting that peeks through the deep single slash Within the artist s seminal oeuvre connotations to Christianity the Space Age and the human condition are explored through the artist s decisive yet violent gestures They evolved his exploration of Spatialism even further by opening the realm of the paintings towards the intangible lying behind the canvas Fuelled by the explosive innovations and developments of these decades the artist was motivated by the notion of the death of the traditional oil painting an antiquated and outdated art form While the ruptures on the canvas surface imitate an infinite cosmology its bold laceration evokes the notion of a human wound Echoing a contemporary interpretation of Christ s wounds his body of work associates the Christian notion of sacrifice with the artist s own revolutionary practice that identified the necessity to violently wound the canvas in order to unlock new dimensions Fontana called upon artists to understand themselves as scientists that in light of an unravelling new vision of the world had to produce what expressed an evolution into new space matter and an ultimately frightening void 
Carla Accardi has created a medium expensive Painting on tempera on canvas in the classic year of 1955.0  My purpose is to represent the vital impulse that is in the world Carla Accardi Known for her groundbreaking calligraphic painterly body of work artist Carla Accardi 1924 2014 is amongst Italy s greatest post war painters Born in Trapani Italy in 1924 the artist received a private art training when she eventually joined the Accademia di Belle Arti in Palermo and Florence In the late 1940s she relocated to Rome and became involved with the Art Club frequently visiting the studios of Consagra and socialising with the inner circle of the city s art scene Together with Carla Lonzi and Elvira Banotti Accardi formed the first Italian feminist collective in 1970 Rivolta Femminile Her legacy has long established her works as significant contributions to an artistic era preceding the height of the Arte Povera Whilst many of her contemporaries experimented with the utilisation of unconventional and humble material Accardi s oeuvre focussed on the investigation of colour pigmentation and new compositions of abstract form on the canvas Her paintings explored the dynamic potential of non figurative elements through vibrant brushstrokes and the appropriation of new material such as sicofoil Through Accardi s extensive practice and experimentations with colour and form the artist informed a wide ranging revolution of gestural abstractionist painting In the early 1950s she was included in the seminal group exhibition Arte astratta e concreta in Italia at the Galleria Nazionale D arte Moderna in Rome By the 1960s Accardi started exhibiting new bodies of work at the Venice Biennale which proved significantly influential for the Arte Povera movement Today her works are part of international public and private collections such as at the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum in New York the Galleria Nazionale d Arte Moderna e Contemporanea in Rome and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice among others The signs must therefore be understood as sequences of decisions instruments of transport in space and time They move like a strange imaginary creature either in the direction of history or destiny they are magmas addressing identity that is difference They make their way across the continuous black surface like an attempt to overturn the writing and reading that has market the history of art Germano Celant The present work La Tela di Penelope 1955 is a beautiful example of Accardi s highly characteristic tempera works on canvas During the early fifties different clusters of new globalised artistic spirits across literature and art emerged in favour of a new language that prioritised imagination over the literate International art movements such as action painting influenced a new generation of European artists that brought to light unprecedented painterly experimentation During this time Accardi starts a new series of white on black paintings It had been a year of crisis I was very discouraged and believed I could go no further in painting An in isolation I began to paint directly on the floor drawing signs But I used white on black black on white didn t stimulate me because of its obviousness because of the fact that at the particular moment the artist had to have a sensation of uniqueness of novelty to drive him on I did those paintings quickly on the floor and for years that was how I worked because I couldn t conceive of drawing signs like that in connection with easel paintings There was always someone asking me how on earth I could work like that It seemed and perhaps really was an incredibly laborious process There are photographs that show me kneeling on the floor or walking on the canvas I used a brush but with a can with paint Carla Accardi This diffusion of performance and painting characterised through the genre of action painting emphasised the process of the artist Within her oeuvre Accardi reversed her visual handwriting by addressing a negotiation between painting and body favouring the latter Her antithesis is defined in the white on black application defying the traditional black on white Evolving from her earlier Sfumati body of work these paintings overturn the hierarchy of form and colour Black and white with the use of casein spread to form signs serves to emphasise unity and distinction between contrary elements Yet the element do not represent opposition but express detachment thats seeks individuality Germano Celant describes her works from the 1950s up to 1957 as a vehicle for identity and difference In the titles of her artworks from this time Accardi makes personal as well as historical references La Tela di Penelope translated to Penelope s web refers to the english proverbial expression as well as to Homer s The Oddyssey in which Odysseus s wife Penelope weaves and unweaves Laertes s burial shroud each day so as to avoid having to choose a suitor

Mimmo Rotella has created a medium expensive Painting on Artypo-plastique in the classic year of 1972.0 Arguably a pioneer of the Italian Pop Art movement Rotella 1918 2006 developed several techniques that would chronicle his time and marry the power of iconic film advertising and popular imagery to the history of painting from d collage to blank retro d affiche photo emulsion and artypo With the development of the Artypo motivated by his growing interest in typography the term combines art and typography Mimmo Rotella continued to disrupt and subvert the function of printed advertising posters by isolating and layering fragments of sfogliacci Playing with images modulating them as if in a visual orchestra the artist gave life to a series of intertwined icons through his compositions of coloured layers Demonstrating his own creative use of typographical processes the artist selected posters amongst those printing proofs typographers would normally discard which he then either mounted them on canvas or laminated These proofs whose function was merely that of warming up printing presses controlling registers and quality of both colours and images presented a collection of randomly placed images with areas of overprinting a superimposition entirely dictated by the element of chance Rotella s La Libert 1972 is an Artypo plastique part of a series of Artypos for which the artist experimented with a perspex layer giving the work a laminated appearance Here the artist superimposed several image sources a Levi s Schweppes and San Pelligrino advert with a photograph of the Statue of Liberty 
Jannis Kounellis has created a large expensive Sculpture on Steel, plaster, paint, glass, tape and cloth in the classic year of 1980.0  The work of a painter is to free something without imposing it Jannis Kounellis As a pioneering figure of Arte Povera Kounellis used poor materials relics and fragments of Mediterranean history and everyday life placing these objects in often startling juxtapositions to create a new poetic context Kounellis conjures a 20th century version of the mythic village blacksmith forging his environments with wood coal iron and fire Jannis Kounellis 1936 Greece 2017 Italy made a highly distinctive contribution to one of the most provocative artistic movements in postwar Europe As a pioneer of Arte Povera in the late 1960s he created spectacular sculptures out of poor mundane objects pieces of wood coal sacking steel and lead arranged in startling juxtapositions on gallery walls or piled unceremoniously on the floor In this way the materials different physical qualities and functional associations were emphasised to strengthen their viewers perception of everyday reality In the 1970s and 1980s Kounellis continued to build his vocabulary of materials introducing smoke shelving units trolleys blockaded openings mounds of coffee grounds and coal as well as other indicators of commerce transportation and economics These diverse fragments speak to general cultural history while they simultaneously combine to form a rich and evocative history of meaning within Kounellis s oeuvre The wall mounted three dimensional pieces seem to talk the language of painting rather than sculpture and within Mensola 1980 which is translated as shelf this connection is further underlined with the use of bright paint and classical sculpture Moreover ancient Greek and Roman artists were known to have applied paint onto their marble gods and leaders making it a great homage to the history of art Kounellis feeling for antiquity is perhaps unsurprising Born in Piraeus the port of Athens son of Gregory and Evangelia Kounellis he emigrated to Rome at the age of 20 after initially studying art in Athens But Kounellis did not shy away from contemporary influences either while attending the city s Accademia di Belle Arti in the late 1950s he was profoundly affected by the most avant garde Italian art ranging from Alberto Burri s stitched scraps of sacking to Piero Manzoni s achromes completely white canvases covered with unorthodox materials such as China clay felt or rolls of bread Ordinary objects and natural matter hold a directness and immediacy for Kounellis whilst at the same time suggesting qualities of permanence and stability and conveying the effort of the artist to establish more concrete communication between the viewer and the artwork Kounellis s work has developed as a spectacular mixture of painting collages and the staging of installations environments performances and theatrical shows designed to express the tensions and the multiplicity obscurity and fragmentation of its language As a major conceptual artists of our time Kounellis work is to be found in the permanent collections of numerous major international art museums The size and weight of the materials used somehow connote the metaphoric weight of the issues Kounellis confronts issues that we are powerless as individuals to do anything about The aim through the juxtaposition of these archetypically traditional and rustic not to mention live elements was to make a statement on the fragmentation of modern life Man in Kounellis s view has always been an irreplaceable centrality and an open border He sees the realities and frustrations of contemporary society while simultaneously drawing upon primitive fundamental human values and the human objects that embody and contain and measure those values These values have not changed and the need for their constant measure is a necessity as pressing as it ever was Kounellis art is a brutal moral insistence but also an affirmation of freedom Through the use of non traditional media in his artistic practice Kounellis explores a sense of unease and alienation of our contemporary society which is built on the industry but still attempts to refer to traditional values and history As a result of his artistic language Kounellis works have been linked with the Arte Povera group whose members such as Mario Merz Giovanni Anselmo and Giuseppe Penone employed poor materials to create profound artistic meaning In using such democratic earthly matter manipulated by nature industry and his own hand Kounellis wanted to speak directly to his viewer in order to explore what is at the heart of human life in the industrial age Paola Nicolin reviewed a two location show of Kounellis s work writing His work always suggests a register beyond the range of the visual Indeed the dense industrial materials earthen hues and odors that are typical of Kounellis s art elicit in me a magical synesthetic response

Per Kirkeby has created a medium expensive Painting on Tempera on canvas in the classic year of 2009.0 Widely respected as a painter sculptor filmmaker architect and author Danish artist Per Kirkeby 1938 2018 was one of the most versatile and accomplished artists of the 20th Century Over a career spanning nearly six decades he developed a unique approach to painting gradually refining a personal palette and vocabulary of images derived primarily from observations of the natural world Kirkeby s ideas about landscape and his sensitivity to natural light and color are easily traced to his study of natural history and geology at the University of Copenhagen where as a student in the late 1950s he participated in numerous expeditions to the Arctic and Greenland These experiences provided an important visual foundation for Kirkeby s future practice especially in the case of painting which the artist often described as an ongoing process of sedimentation An equally important touchstone for Kirkeby was his evolving dialogue with art history in particular modernist abstraction 17th century Dutch still life painting Northern European landscape painting and Byzantine Art Driven by deeply conceptual interests in science art history and literature Kirkeby s art remains grounded in painting It is this unlikely synthesis which marks Kirkeby s profound contribution as an artist His first exhibition coincided with the completion of his studies in geology in 1964 Kirkeby has exhibited internationally ever since Kirkeby represented Denmark in the 1976 and 1980 Venice Biennales and later participated in documenta VII and documenta IX Works by Kirkeby are found in many museum collections worldwide including Tate London Centre Pompidou Paris Metropolitan Museum of Art New York and Museum of Modern Art New York among many others 
Peter Saul has created a large expensive Painting on Acrylic, oil on canvas in the classic year of 2010.0 Peter Saul b 1934 is one of the most important and influential contemporary artists of the twentieth century and has consistently challenged art history and politics with his radical unrefined style Positioned outside of the canon of Contemporary and Pop Art Saul s exuberantly grotesque works feature an ironic and caustic humor that simultaneously breaks down and celebrates his subjects Influenced by both French academic painting and MAD magazine Saul s steadfast embrace of narrative and figuration in painting have left him at odds with every major movement in art as he has transformed over sixty years into a profound albeit unconventional history painter Early in his career while living in Paris Saul challenged Abstract Expressionism by infusing its style with low brow commercial imagery In the 1970s Saul moved to San Francisco in the United States where his work grew increasingly political he addressed the Vitenam War and the Civil Rights movement as well as American economic social and political systems From around the 1980s onward Saul continued his critical exploration of art but turned his eye towards conventions of art history He would repaint portraits in his own distinct style referencing such masterpieces as Picasso s Guernica and Marcel DuChamp s Nude Descending a Staircase The Picture is supposed to be about it s subject the artist explains The human figure has to do its part has to be shaped to contribute to the expression All that formal value of formal inventory means to me is at the end of the picture it s got to be satisfying for me to look at darks dark enough brights bright enough everything finished round set in space Even if I make it up as I go along it has to check out I prefer things to look at least slightly in motion as they re happening not quietly stacked up like on a store shelf Stupid Argument was included in the critically acclaimed career retrospective Crime and Punishment which was on view at the New Museum in New York in 2020

Julio Le Parc has created a medium expensive Painting on acrylic paint on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Julio Le Parc is internationally recognized as one of the leading names in Optical and Kinetic art Over the course of six decades he has performed groundbreaking experiments on light movement and color seeking to promote new possibilities for the relationship between art and society from a utopian perspective The artist s canvases sculptures and installations challenge the traditional Art Historical definition of paintings he uses mediums that pertain to pictorial tradition such as acrylic on canvas while incorporating formal kinetic processes in the assemblages and apparatuses he employs Le Parc s series are often developed during long periods of time whereby the artist interrupts and resumes his investigations positioning them as elements of a larger longstanding and overarching research on color and light The paintings making up the series Alchimie are an example of this practice Having begun the body of work in 1988 as a derivation of Modulations a series dating back to 1974 based on experimentation with waves and virtual colors Alchemies are embodiments of Le Parc s further investigation into volumetrics also entwining his early studies on the permutations of colors from the 1950s In these paintings the artist delves into the question of light refraction with color particles either concentrated or dispersed on the surface which reinforce the spatial dimension of the canvas It is also interesting to note the numerous kinetic effects in the compositions which emerge as Le Parc proposes different relationships between color sequences

Guillaume Bijl has created a large nominal Installation on Mixed Media in the modern year of 2021.0  The word sorry is a prototypical cool word of this age When in 1987 I started compiling a number of absurd assemblages from existing objects and thus made abstractions I was being unfaithful to my own realistic form I called those little works sorries Later on I also made a number of larger absurd installations in which I consistently insinuated the human figure in a surreal tableau My Compositions are a logical consequence of the way in which I manipulate themes and materials in my larger installations These Compositions however are devoid of all situational pretensions I myself would describe the relationship in my uvre between the compositions and installations as follows If I were to interpret my larger installations as large tableaux my compositions would relate to them as sketches or small drawings In general I wish to regard them as a present day archeological still life GB Bijl the euro weirdo existing on the fringe of artworld purview Probably in need of a retrospective Bijl is the missing link between Broodthaers display tact as object creedence lent and today s culturo marxist surrealists Sign detached ever so slightly from its signified like wearing a mask of its own face Tableau in which the performers perform themselves And question of How could I ever possibly be not be myself Is the Scrooge McDuck staring into you still the Scrooge McDuck when he is set into the alternate blank white universe where he acts only as a referent sign to himself or was he always only a referent to himself Quoted from Guillaume Bijl at Nagel Draxler Contemporary Art Writing Daily April 2016 source artwritingdaily com

Mary Heilmann has created a small nominal Painting on Acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2020.0 Influenced by 1960s counterculture the free speech movement and the surf ethos of her native California Mary Heilmann ranks amongst the most influential abstract painters of her generation Considered one of the preeminent contemporary Abstract painters Heilmann s practice overlays the analytical geometries of Minimalism with the spontaneous ethos of the Beat Generation and are always distinguishable by their often unorthodox always joyful approach to color and form For over 25 years Heilmann has been living and working between New York City and the oceanside hamlet of Bridgehampton on Long Island s storied East End For most of the global pandemic Heilmann remained in Bridgehampton marking the longest consecutive period she has ever spent at her Long Island studio Acid Crash 2020 is part of a series of new paintings Heilmann has completed over the months of the pandemic while sequestered in Bridgehampton She immersed herself in the mutable conditions of light air and colors specific to the oceanfront environment channeling her observations into new paintings that expand upon her ongoing fascination with waves and water Drawing from a life lived on both coasts Heilmann s childhood and college years were informed by her immersion in California s landscape and surf culture Acid Crash and these newer works synthesize her memories of the scenic highways and coastal vistas of her youth with the ever changing elusive geometries of Atlantic Ocean waves Acid Crash spotlights Heilmann s distinctively sculptural approach to paint and unique ability to elicit complex associations through deceptively simple forms In contrast to earlier paintings that depict water the artist s new works find her taking a more formalist approach creating representations of a wave s spirals tubes and undulations To evoke the texture of sand Heilmann has employed here for the first time a grainy medium mixed into her paint to enhance its thickness and tactility on which her teal green waters rise on the surface of the canvas Acid Crash reinforces the artist s consistent inventiveness and deep connection with the boundless unknowability of the ocean and the landscape of her America

Roni Horn has created a large expensive Sculpture on Solid cast glass with as-cast surfaces in the classic year of 2013.0 Untitled Surprisingly suddenly the children s voices had gone It is a thing that happens on summer nights one moment they are there and then without a call or a warning they are gone but it is difficult to be sure whether they go because they sense the mystery of on coming night or whether the on coming night is mysterious because they are gone Meticulously executed Untitled Surprisingly suddenly the children s voices had gone It is a thing that happens on summer nights one moment they are there and then without a call or a warning they are gone but it is difficult to be sure whether they go because they sense the mystery of on coming night or whether the on coming night is mysterious because they are gone 2013 2017 is an outstanding example Roni Horn s highly technical sculptures Horn s longstanding exploration of and engagement with cast glass sculptures dates back to the mid 1990s and underscores her exploratory practice To produce these works coloured molten glass is poured into a mould which gradually hardens over the course of several months The resulting sculpture is highly textural its sides are rough with the impression of the mould in which it was cast while its fire polished top is smooth and glossy resembling a crystalline pool of water Reflecting on her interest in glass as a medium Horn states In the glass pieces what fascinates me has a lot to do with the essence of something that has one appearance but is really something completely different For example glass is a super cooled liquid not a solid It s a pretty amazing thing that a material as ubiquitous as glass can masquerade like that It s like having a mask but the mask is identical to the real thing 1 Due to its formal properties in particular its captivating transparency the sculpture appears to be in a constant state of change adapting its appearance to its surroundings Gradations of sunlight and shadow activate the work fluctuating between heft and lightness solidity and fluidity and opacity and transparency In this way Horn s glass sculptures embody the heart of her practice probing the relationship between mutability and place As they change in relation to the weather that surrounds them and the quotations with which they are associated these sculptures seduce in their resistance to common visual understanding and ironically to clarity Literary themes which are present throughout much of Horn s work are also reflected in her glass sculptures The artist derives titles for works from quotations sourced from the writings of authors like Emily Dickinson Flannery O Connor Hank Williams and Anne Carson Horn s titles offer a narrative portal through which to enter and explore her work while still retaining an open and ambiguous quality For this sculpture Horn quotes from Elizabeth Taylor s first novel At Mrs Lippincote s written in 1945 The title simultaneously poetic concerning and perplexing draws attention to paradoxical and experiential qualities of the artist s work 1 Roni Horn quoted in Roni Horn Everything Was Sleeping as if the Universe Were a Mistake Barcelona ES Fundaci Joan Mir 2014 p 128 
Matthew Day Jackson has created a large expensive Painting on Wood, oil paint, epoxy, acrylic paint, urethane plastic, lead, stainless steel frame in the modern year of 2021.0 Matthew Day Jackson works in sculpture film photography printmaking painting and performance exploring the dialectics of past and present and the narrative of his identity within history These investigations address American Dream mythologies science and technology modes of power and its abuses through the use of disparate materials and methods of production A consummate experimenter Jackson is often developing processes that are new to contemporary art and central to what would be considered a signature style In his latest series of paintings Jackson reinterprets the iconic imagery of American landscape by painters such as Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Moran These paintings of Yellowstone and Yosemite played a fundamental role in the formation of American conceptions of State Beauty and Nature and were a driving force in the nation building exercise of national park development and expansion By reinterpreting these works into three dimensional paintings Jackson creates an illusory space in which the viewer can simultaneously experience the closeness to the physical work and the distance to the actual landscape The brushstrokes that rendered the original paintings are replaced by a process of a CNC four color airbrush on a three dimensional layered bas relief the original colors of the painting are lost in the translation of the digital process The result is an extraterrestrial landscape familiar yet strange that invites the viewer to question the renderings of the world around us With Bridal Veil Falls after Bierstadt Jackson embraces his role as a creator and storyteller combining old practices and contemporary technologies to create a work layered with meaning 
Glenn Ligon has created a medium expensive Painting on Etching ink, ink marker, and oil stick on canvas in the modern year of 2020.0 Glenn Ligon s Study for Debris Field 39 2021 continues his career long investigation of the interplay between abstraction and figuration which underpins the conceptual and formal concerns of his practice Departing from his earlier text based works which borrow from James Baldwin Ralph Ellison Gertrude Stein and Jean Genet Ligon s Debris Field series focuses on letterforms based on his own etchings and stencil drawings rather than literary passages Ligon renders Study for Debris Field 39 through overlapping silk screened etching ink oil stick and marker ink continuing his practice of addition and repetition as a means to alter abstract and obscure legibility The letter based shapes that punctuate the work s surface present a complex articulation of meaning eschewing direct reading Here black letters are upturned inverted smudged scraped and overpainted interrupted by gaps and streaks and set in sharp relief against a white ground Ligon adds a layer of black marker ink highlighting some letterforms by circling them while covering others completely as he draws across the canvas creating a black field Layers of letterforms are stenciled with etching ink and oil stick rendering them with unique and distinct textures The forms that traverse the canvas produce an abstract topology dissolving any sense of orderly language As Helen Molesworth contends A debris field is any location or site that contains the wreckage of what was once a whole object For Ligon the debris field is the fate of language under the pressures of unresolved and conventionally unspoken racism which undergirds the American project These debris fields of language politely perform the profundity of not being able to make sense of the senseless 1 1 Helen Molesworth Glenn Ligon Untitled America Debris Field Synecdoche Notes for a Poem on the Third World Los Angeles Regen Projects 2019 p 49 
Vik Muniz has created a small nominal Photography on archival inkjet print in the modern year of 2021.0 Vik Muniz body of work explores the limits of representations within visual arts twinning his production with an urge to grasp the world s current state of affairs Using raw materials such as thorn paper cotton sugar chocolate or waste the artist meticulously composes landscapes portraits or other depictions offering alternative representations and understandings of these materials and the images they render According to the critic and curator Luisa Duarte his work demands a retrospective gaze from the public In order to read his photos one must question and analyse the process of making the materials used as well as identify the original image so as to attain the meaning of the image Vik s work brings into play a series of questions for our regard and creates a space for doubt which is where we build our understanding His series Surfaces is one of Vik Muniz s most recent series which he began developing in 2019 The body of work establishes an entropic negotiation between the loss of material and its virtual gain In combining actual collage and photographed collage the artist plays on illusion leading the spectator to meditate on their relationship with the physical experience of the artwork in an era when the convenience and omnipresence of immaterial digital images are constantly transforming the idea of reality itself Muniz subtracts the concrete element that differentiates a painting from a photograph and re presents it as a layered image Though the artist employs painting both as process and concept the work is not a painting and as a photographic image of an artwork that already exists autonomously and physically it is also not an abstraction thus engaging the viewer with the question of perception illusion and the conceptual implications of each of the entwined media 
Marcelo Silveira has created a large nominal Sculpture on cajacatinga wood, beeswax and metallic pin in the classic year of 2009.0 Marcelo Silveira s work questions and challenges long established categories related to art such as sculpture folk art craftwork and collecting His works often depart from the idea of materiality and how anything can become a medium spearheading his use of wood leather paper metal plastic and glass amongst many other materials Silveira s investigation also addresses the idea of the use and purpose of materials or objects which he suggests can be defined by a common socially determined repertoire as is the case for bottles or glasses and uprooted by recreating familiar shapes using unexpected materials Additionally the concept of collecting is central to the artist s practice with a constant play between production and appropriation Silveira addresses the question in numerous ways whether it be by presenting an accumulation of found artifacts such as postcards rulers or perfume bottles by incorporating un usable domestic utensils or by showcasing his work as an assemblage whereby each part is a fragment of a whole Organization or arrangement is therefore a fundamental aspect of the artist s work not only in terms of exhibiting strategically but also as an instrument for re defining and reformulating his materials 
Hans-Jörg Mayer has created a medium cheap Painting on Egg tempera, acrylic on canvas in the classic year of 2012.0 The international military campaign launched by the U S government after the September 11 attacks known as the Global War on Terrorism GWOT recently culminated in a dramatic withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan that left the country in a disastrous state Osama bin Laden was killed on May 2 2011 To many his death offered a relief to find that America can still fix a bull s eye on a difficult goal stick with it year after frustrating year and succeed when almost no one expects it as David Von Drehle put it in a special issue of TIME published shortly afterward For the cover of that issue TIME went with a concept that had only been used three other times in the magazine s history the red X The first was in 1945 for Adolf Hitler another X ed out cover that year marked the end of World War II with the crossing out of Japan s rising sun but in that case the X was black the second in 2003 for Saddam Hussein and the third in 2006 for Abu Mousab al Zarqawi HJM began his skeptical career in the 1980s by rejecting everything expressive which initially led him in two directions representational painting between realism and pop art on the one hand and slogan paintings in the aesthetics of advertising and record covers on the other Both develop over time into increasingly fragile graffiti like painting on bright white canvas hastily painted with conspicuous drippings The backgrounds disappear in favor of a kind of white void of infinite expanse 
Maria Klabin has created a large cheap Painting on oil paint on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Maria Klabin s work engages with scenes occurrences and landscapes that permeate everyday life and thus have been seen and experienced exhaustively In dealing with omnipresent elements Klabin extracts the cadence of their recurrence seeking to capture the formal rhythm embedded in the repetition or banality of their existence The artist s process lays in constantly producing and assembling drawings photographs and annotations which she draws from her immediate entourage The accumulation of thoughts and images entwine and come to make sense as a whole unveiling intriguing relations that form the backbone of the artist s pictorial endeavor In her own words Klabin develops her work as if writing a story or a diary but a diary of things that don t really happen It s a narrative that could only be told through painting but that touches themes that seem closer to writers than to painters Maria Klabin oscillates between extremes in terms of the scale of her works producing both very small and monumental large scale paintings depending on the nature of her subject Her small canvases often serve as support for rapid streams of thought like writing on paper perhaps harnessing an unconscious mind and effectively capturing the rhythm of her surroundings while her large pieces embody more contemplative oneiric perceptions Most recently Klabin has produced a series of landscape paintings that depart from fragments of autobiographical elements distilled from what she describes as an improbable and fluid patchwork of memory that results in non objectifiable enticing yet daunting compositions 
Cosima von Bonin has created a large nominal Mixed Media on Wool and cotton fringed scarf with fabric applique and embroidery in the classic year of 1999.0 Cosima von Bonin s sculptures paintings and installations made of fabric which often take up themes and motifs from popular culture can be seen as an ironically subversive artistic approach that combines mainstream and criticism in a typically female technique She found the plaid for the work Blazon of a hash country 1999 in the Istanbul souks Normally used as a woman s garment to wrap the body in Bonin unfolds it into a painting Applied is a smiley in the upper left corner which counteracts the traditional aspect of the plaid and an embroidery of the cover of the cult record Arise Therefore by American singer songwriter and actor Joseph Will Oldham born January 15 1970 From 1993 to 1997 Oldham performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under variations of the name Palace Palace Palace Flophouse Palace Brothers Palace Songs and Palace Music After briefly publishing music under his own name in 1998 he adopted Bonnie Prince Billy as the name for most of his work For Bonin who in her practice has often collaborated with others especially musicians Bonnie Prince Billy is a kindred spirit

 has created a small expensive Painting on Water-based paint on canvas in the classic year of 1960.0  When in 58 I started cutting up canvases until only the frame was left to see it is certain that I was putting myself in contradiction with the type of art practised at the time Dadamaino Born Edoarda Dada Emilia Maino 1930 2004 Italian artist Dadamaino emerged during the 1950s in Milan Initially trained in pharmaceutical studies she eventually pursued an artistic practice soon becoming a defining pioneer within the Italian avant garde movements of the time Acclaimed for her monochromatic black and white hole paintings the Volumi Volumes series are evocative of Lucio Fontana s Buchi Holes that informed the groundbreaking art movement Spatialism Dadamaino described Fontana s influence as existential to the development of her artistic practice I always hated matter and sought immateriality Of course Fontana played a decisive role in the history of my painting if Fontana had not pierced the canvas probably I would not have dared to do so either It totally removed matter to the point of making visible parts of the canvas to remove any material element to deprive it of any such rhetoric and return to tabula rasa in purity In 1959 the artist joined the artistic group Azimuth originally founded by Agostino Bonalumi Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni For the occasion of an exhibition in the Netherlands her name was mistakenly spelt as one word Dadamaino which the artist would eventually adopt as her pseudonym In the 1960s the artist s work was influenced by an increasing fascination with movement developing a series of optical and non static artworks Works such as Fatti della Vita Facts of Life shown at the Venice Biennale in 1980 exemplify a later shift in her practice towards text based art Today works by Dadamaino are part of important private and public collections around the world such as the Tate Gallery in London and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice The work Volume 1960 a transfixing example of Dadamaino s famous early monochromatic paintings is a powerful statement of her acclaimed Volumi series The rectangular shape of the canvas features sharp yet precise piercings into the canvas They violently appear in an adversely orderly constellation of nine rows with three holes Each hole reveals an opening originating from a square form cut diagonally to the middle point and carefully propped open towards the viewer The Volumi works represent a defining moment in Dadamaino s practice marking a seminal turning point in the visual rhetoric of the artist s work Volume 1960 exemplifies the investigative potential of rhythm explored through codes and immersive environments 
Claudio Verna has created a medium nominal Painting on Acrylic and oil on canvas in the classic year of 1976.0  I call myself a painter because I think I can express myself only with colour Claudio Verna Claudio Verna born in Guardiagrele Italy 1937 lives and works in Rome differed in terms of approach from most of his contemporaries who were experimenting with new unique and combined mediums to make a statement against tradition and as a natural progression from avant garde art in Europe By the end of 1960s together with a small group of artists such as Giorgio Griffa Riccardo Guarneri and Claudio Olivieri Claudio Verna established the movement called Pittura Analitica also known as Pittura Pittura marking a return to painting then considered a dying art form Aiming to analyse the material elements of painting canvas frame paint colour mark and the relationship between artist and artwork Pittura Pittura was an absolute purist movement which at once freed itself of the referential links to reality typical of figurative painting of the language of expression that characterised abstract painting and of the underlying meaning embedded in conceptual art In many ways the movement s formalist principles embodied the essence of what could be the Italian response to Minimalism Hard edge to Colour Field one could draw many parallels with North American painting from the 1960 s including leading figures such as Frank Stella Barnett Newman and Kenneth Noland However towards the end of the 1970 s in the later phase of the movement as it is well exemplified by Verna s works created after 1978 the absolutely analytical nature of Pittura Pittura started fading Verna for instance achieved a different dimension in his work characterised by the release of colour while the quality of his surfaces as an energy vacuum continue to dominate his later works his language has evolved to include freer brushstrokes and colour contrasts within a single work and he continues to create new dimensions through colour fields rendered in different ways dividing the space of the canvas into geometric yet at times unexpected shapes and surfaces Pittura 1976 is part of a series of numerous acrylic and oil paintings characterised by a conscious exploration of painting with a focus on the medium s constructive elements including space form paint and the colour white as means to materialise a new dimension While Verna suggested that his use of colour was a means for him to maximise his artistic expression it was evidently also a reflection on the medium of paint its potential and the process of making an image The artist often referred to as master of colour by critics was not expecting viewers to read into his works nor attempt to find meaning through them His main goal was to grant them access to a new space dominated by colour in this instance the colour white For Verna white is never a neutral pigment or a symbol of emptiness In fact it is the colour containing all other colours As curator Piero Tomassoni explains Verna s monochrome paintings are never actually monochromatic they always contain a diversity of colours which are juxtaposed interlaced and mixed together In the white paintings different tones emerge with time as the chemical properties of the acrylic varnish produce slight mutations over the years What s more their veiled white surfaces allow the iridescent substratum to vary in appearance through different light exposure and as the observer changes position in relation to the work By interrupting the picture plane with lines and fields of different colours blurring in the background Verna sought to make the eyes of the viewer move from one side of the painted surface to the other Verna s works have been exhibited widely in Italy and beyond since the late 1960 s and included in the Venice Biennales of 1970 and 1980 
Davide Balliano has created a medium cheap Painting on Plaster, gesso & varnish on wood in the modern year of 2019.0  I think that my research lately seems to be focused on the power struggle between labour as human identity and the ferocious efficacy of technology passing through time and its perception and ending with the contemplation of the sublime Davide Balliano Contemporary artist Davide Balliano b 1983 was born in Turin and in 2006 relocated to New York City where he currently lives and works His sculptures and paintings widely exhibited worldwide present a characteristic minimal and geometric visual language expressed through black and white surfaces Radiating a crisp perfection through the dynamic geometric composition of line and form Balliano s works exceed geometric linear perfection and calculated optical effects At a closer look they reveal a multitude of minute scratches and scrapes within the plaster and gesso layers applied on wood or linen or delicate drippings of plaster wash transforming seemingly austere surfaces into highly textured ones They straddle the fine line between painting and sculpture for they use materials classically associated to the latter such as plaster white and black gesso Even Balliano s signature geometric elemental motifs initially the arc later the spiral which reappear in his paintings in various iterations and compositions originate from an experimentation with sculpture during the artist s earlier practice Working primarily with black and white Balliano does not reject colour rather he operates in a continuous contemplation about colour For him white is a soft colour with an astounding richness of possible hues that open the door to a complex spatial exploration The space of the canvas which is often delineated by the application of an oak veneer for the works on wooden panels and remains pristine for the thinner lighter works on linen does not end the composition It is visually continued activating the surrounding space of the work through the presentation of a spatial equilibrium between absence and presence With references to icons architecture and nature Balliano s work distils the artist s ongoing confrontation with scientific and emotive concepts concerning the individual s relationship with the macrocosm of things Rejecting at once figuration and abstraction and alongside them a unilateral conceptual reading and interpretation of his work the artist points the viewer s gaze towards something that may not be immediately visible The perceptional and illusional element of his ghost paintings embrace the consideration of a larger presence UNTITLED 0136 2019 highlights the intense interplay of black and white as a fundamental element of the artist s aesthetic On closer inspection the surface reveals heavy intervention into the perfection of the graphic lines Scratches and scrapings become visible on the black surface at times concealed and at others highlighted by a layer of varnish 
Bosco Sodi has created a medium expensive Mixed Media on Mixed media on canvas  in the classic year of 2016.0 Based between New York and Casa Wabi his residence studio and non profit arts centre in Oaxaca Mexico Bosco Sodi b 1970 is known for his preindustrial minimalist sculptures and his highly textured vividly pigmented paintings Working between US and Mexico the artist demonstrates the dichotomy within these two different environments through an investigative admission of their conceptual and geographical climates The present works are a testament to the artist s ability to straddle the natural and the manmade His practice acknowledges and actively incorporates these environments so inherently different both geographically and conceptually They are foundational to his creative process as much as chance and the traditional Japanese aesthetic philosophy of Wabi Sabi are Sodi s artworks are shaped by the artist s choice to embrace the accidental that moment of non control while working in complete harmony with the natural elements Similar to the artists of the Arte Povera movement Sodi explores a wide range of unconventional processes while employing the utilisation of non traditional materials Within the artist s oeuvre the legacy of Arte Povera and its influence on contemporary art continues to live on as the artist continues to reject technological modernism and modes of industrial production Sodi rejects the use of tools he does not delegate the production of his pieces Rather he works in an intensely direct gestural and performative manner therefore generating a uniquely transcendental line of transmission between artist and artwork The painterly and sculptural results reveal surfaces rich of rough textures cracks and chasms Once monochrome bodies created mixing natural materials ground minerals stone clay wood to manmade ones sawdust glues glazes their surfaces are modified by the passing of time They are subject to natural drying processes left to experience and show the marks of weathering or fired in high temperature kilns ultimately revealing beautifully organic structures that subvert the artistic form and stand as relics of Sodi s direct intervention into nature Things become beautiful the more time passes I want to work with the elements not against them Untitled 2016 is a sublime example of the charged emotive power within Sodi s minimalist surfaces that quite literally break through the tension of the dried surface He creates his paintings by applying thick layers of mixed sawdust colour pigments and glue Once the surface dries it is transformed into an intensely three dimensional texture that embraces the accidental absorbing the energy of Sodi s hands on artmaking process The completely white pigmentation and cracked texture of Untitled 2016 is reminiscent of earth like structures dried landscapes Sodi s monochromatic pigmentation transports the work of art into an otherworldly dimension granting the painting an allegorical character that evokes visions such as snowy or dry landscapes the swift movement of vigorous tree branches earth and nature in tension Within the artist s practice the work of art itself becomes a relic a record of the artist s dialogue with nature and his exploration of material 
Mimmo Rotella has created a medium expensive Painting on Photo emulsion on canvas in the classic year of 1968.0 Experimenting with ways to transition from the d collages Mimmo Rotella discovered a technique that later has been defined as significant to the emergence of the Mec Art movement The creation of the photo emulsion technique was a result of Rotella s interest in photography and the rediscovery of the photojournalism of the 1920s and 1930s by both Andy Warhol and himself The photomechanical technique is described by Celant as An almost mechanical process which integrated the experiences of life without being concerned whether the outcome was art or non art with the aim of overturning the sacred and ritual condition of cultural art Allowing Rotella to convey current affairs in greater clarity the technique of the photo emulsion is often characterised as one that manifests a moment in time conveying important chronological events in society During the late 60s Rotella produced a series of photo emulsions as portraits of friends including artists gallerists art dealers etc The subjects range from his artist friends such as American French artist Arman Ritratto di Arman 1968 fashion designer Paco Rabanne Paco Rabanne 1967 artist Roy Lichtenstein Lichtenstein 1968 American sculptor John Chamberlain John Chamberlain 1968 gallerist and art dealer Sidney Janis Sidney Janis 1968 greek gallerist Iris Clert Iris Clert 1966 1967 art collector Robert Calle Bob Calle 1967 prominent art critic Pierre Restany Portrait de Pierre Restany 1965 french actress Jacqueline Delubac Portrait de Jacqueline Delubac 1966 New York socialite and journalist Blair Sabol Portrait of Blair Sabol 1968 artist Prodiaz Portrait de Pro Diaz 1965 and art publisher Harry Abrams Portrait of Harry Abrams 1968 The image sources are presumably photographs that Rotella took himself while he was travelling for work or leisure John Chamberlain Indiana 1927 New York 2011 was a prominent American sculptor who bridged the worlds of Pop Art Minimalism and Abstract Expressionism with his works made of scrap metal especially rusting car parts From the early 1960s the artist introduced new materials such as urethane foam galvanized steel Plexiglas and aluminium foil in his sculptural vocabulary He also experimented in other media from abstract colour paintings to photographs and films amongst which the full length highly erotic underground production The Secret Life of Hernando Cortez filmed in Mexico in 1968 with Warhol regulars Taylor Mead and Ultra Violet Ultra Violet appears as the female figure alongside Chamberlain in Rotella s portrait Isabelle Dufresne Ultra Violet as she became known due to her head to toe shade of choice had been a muse of Dal s and one of Andy Warhol s girls In the 1960 s she also associated herself with artists like Chamberlain Lichtenstein Stella Ruscha and Johns In 1961 Rotella exhibited alongside Chamberlain at MOMA for the major show The Art of Assemblage and again in 1967 at Sidney Janis Gallery Both artists loved poetry and had gained a reputation for their bohemian lifestyles In his autobiography Autorotella the artist mentions having met Chamberlain and Ultra Violet at the opening of the 1967 exhibition He quotes different meetings with her in Paris in the early 60s and at a performance where she was acting with his good friend Taylor Mead in early 1968 the year of this portrait and when both actors starred in Chamberlain s movie 
Heinz Mack has created a medium expensive Painting on   in the classic year of 2014.0  A world without art would be that like a sky in the night without the lights of the stars They appear like meteors ideas fully unexpected only a few people see them Paintings and sculpture are planets of the sun and make you forget the black depths of the night from which they arise A world without art would be a gray world between day and night in which time stands still in an empty room without shadow but also without light Art expresses that a gray world would be unbearable Heinz Mack German artist Heinz Mack b 1931 is acclaimed as co founder of the ZERO art movement and alongside Guenther Uecker and Otto Piene one of the most celebrated artists and representatives of German post war art Born in 1931 the artist currently lives and works between M nchengladbach Germany and Ibiza Spain Mack studied together with Piene at the Kunstakademie D sseldorf before they started an artistic collaboration and founded the famous ZERO movement in 1957 The artist s works are held in the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum collections in New York the Tate Gallery in London and the Calderara Foundation Collection in Milan among others Seeking a radical departure from the traditional conceptions of art the term zero was not meant to convey nihilism but chosen for its connotations of silence meditation and suspension Central to Mack s practice and that of the ZERO movement is the utilisation of light as an immaterial medium The artist explores this through elements of luminescence and colour in relation to space and movement The examination of these expressive elements forges light kinetic movements and spatial structures to a complete unit that Mack surveys in sculpture and painting For the artist the space between light and dark is one that is liminal yet bears origin to perception and vision This key motif is part of a defining series Mack created in 1991 The Chromatic Constellations translate his intuitions of space and application into a chromatic formula Mack s Chromatic Constellations originate from music and refer to the technical term chromaticism the recolouring of pitches by raising them or lowering them by a semitone Inspired by the inclusion of colour as an element in music theory Mack appropriates this concept for a series of defining paintings that contain a rhythmic sequence of colour hues reminiscent of prismatic spatial refractions Untitled Chromatic Constellation 2014 is a monochrome black and white work that through the alternating application of paint and spectrums of tones generates a uniquely dynamic image The luminous spectrum of this painting unfolding through pure colour distils thought and energy

Rita Ackermann has created a large expensive Painting on Acrylic, oil and china marker on canvas  in the modern year of 2021.0 The opposing impulses of creation and destruction are the touchstones of Hungarian born New York based artist Rita Ackermann s practice Ackermann s compositions are often the product of automatic lines and gestures a subconscious unfolding of form through which the paintings arrive at a space between figuration and abstraction In her most recent series Mama repeated imagery is combined with vivid swathes of color figures and motifs rise to the surface of the canvas only to dissolve and reappear elsewhere In Mama Good Samaritan 2021 drawings in china marker are left visible obscured only partially by layers of impastoed oil paint vigorously applied and scraped Bursts of bold colors lead the viewer s eyes across the canvas from the figures on the right to the whirlpool of red yellow and green in the foreground The layering and visual complexity thwarts any efforts to read the works as stories rendering them ultimately unknowable 
George Condo has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil stick, acrylic, pastel on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Made in October 2021 George Condo s painting Going Out of my Mind offers a pertinent examination of our shared collective state of mind during an unprecedented moment in history The last 18 months have been a remarkably prolific period for Condo with him starting a number of important new series including Distanced Figures and Blues Paintings In an interview with the BBC shortly before he completed this painting Condo described what it has been like being back out in the real world after being doubly vaccinated and the kind of work it has inspired him to create I started to do these paintings that look like insane families that have been let out of their cage And now I m starting to work on the individual characters 1 Going Out of my Mind is part of this extraordinary body of work which astutely explores the different emotional states and fragmented psyches experienced by many during this unsettling period This painting is a striking example of Condo s ability to capture the paradoxes and contradictions of the human condition through a blend of abstraction and figuration Executed in acrylic pastel and oil stick on canvas the composition is simultaneously dynamic reflective and disconcerting Condo combines multiple perspectives into a single viewpoint simultaneously portraying a range of emotions and radically reimagining the genres of both caricature and portraiture As Simon Baker suggests in his monograph on Condo the artist has always used utterly outrageous and unimaginably deranged subjects to reflect on real life using the outer limits of fantasy to characterize the social political psychological moral and ethical dimensions of reality as he sees it 2 1 George Condo in In the Studio George Condo Painting a new world https www bbc co uk sounds play w3ct1tdl 2 Simon Baker George Condo Painting Reconfigured London UK Thames Hudson 2015 p 181

Jannis Varelas has created a large nominal Painting on oil, gouache, glue and gesso on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Jannis Varelas was born 1977 in Athens Greece lives and works in Athens and Los Angeles USA For many years he was recording political conversations and conversations originated by social interests among his family and friends on the one hand because of the fascination of those ideas that were developed spontaneously impromptu and on the other hand there was a great interest on the very essential structure which was created within the conversational schemata These structures gave Varelas a very interesting and revealing comprehension of logos under the form of the uttered word and also the word remaining within to use the words of Philo of Alexandria As for the abstract pieces his main concern is to reveal the structure of spoken language in the context of verbal exchange He tries to use symbols and scribbled lines that are appearing and reappearing again alongside with colours and gestures creating an analogue to the expressive ways of language His work is based on a layering process He starts with a basic symbolic language consisting of signs such as hearts anchors breasts letters M A X referring to Levi Strauss and the anthropological structuralism that he used in order to analyse the linguistic system that primitive tribes used to categorize weather conditions as well as the flora and fauna that surrounded them On his works he replaces the language of primitive tribes with the symbols that we used to carve on our desks and write on the walls on our very early youth After the first layer is applied on the canvas he works on top of that using more complex and abstract forms related with a disordering process It could be said that he is obsessed with what Alighiero Boetti specified as the twin poles of order and disorder In other words He is very keen on the process of erasing and remaking on top of his painted surface leaving the traces visible to the eye and creating what we could call a palimpsest

Paul McCarthy has created a large expensive Work on Paper on Pencil, pastel and oil stick on paper in the modern year of 2020.0 Striking in scale A E ADOOF ADOOLH Santa Anita session 2020 exemplifies the irreverent humour and biting satire of Paul McCarthy s unorthodox practice Here McCarthy achieves a powerful intensity through a blend of abstraction and figuration The artist cleverly combines wordplay with a panoply of images erotic imagery deformed portraits and textual annotation to address themes of violence humour death sex and politics The work is highly intricate consisting of a riot of bold colours smears and whiplash strokes Closer inspection reveals a highly textural surface including several objects embedded on the paper such as a pastel stick Though many of these items are obscured by McCarthy s gestural charcoal marks and punctuated use of colour they contribute to the drawing s dynamic and almost sculptural appearance Created during a series of freely improvised performances between Paul McCarthy and the German actress Lilith Stangenberg A E Drawing Session Santa Anita comprises a group of new works on paper in which themes of violence and power coalesce In keeping with McCarthy s multidisciplinary oeuvre the drawings have evolved from the artist s film project NV Night Vader 2019 which is loosely based on Liliana Cavani s sadomasochistic erotic drama The Night Porter 1974 This epic film project features a deranged cast of characters including McCarthy as Max a mafioso like Hollywood executive and Stangenberg in the role of Lucia the central character of the 1974 movie who here plays a young German actress Forming the narrative basis for these new drawings NV Night Vader is a sharp critique of violence and exploitation offering a powerful commentary on fascism Hollywood the contemporary art world and the current political climate The title s acronym A E which refers to Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun Adam and Eve and Arts and Entertainment signals that this work carries the multivalent force for which McCarthy is known A E finds the artist and the actress transformed into Hitler and Braun with the former embodying predatory toxic masculinity and buffoonery while Eva is at once lover mother and daughter In turn A E ADOOF ADOOLH Santa Anita session is at once a collage part of a script for a performance a physical record of an ephemeral project the creation of a fictional character and perhaps above all an integral part of McCarthy s fundamental subversion of conventional understandings of traditional media and work processes It fittingly belongs to a series that is simultaneously shocking humorous and sardonic hallmark characteristics of McCarthy s oeuvre and is an outstanding example of the artist s provocative and ground breaking practice Paul McCarthyPhoto Fredrik Nilsen

Jack Whitten has created a large expensive Painting on Acrylic on hollow core door in the classic year of 2011.0 In Egyptian Indigo 2011 Jack Whitten combines innovative processes and techniques from his decades long practice to create a striking painting that not only explores the possibilities of abstraction but also reflects upon prominent historical events Departing from Whitten s tessellated mosaics of the 1990s fluctuating indigo blue hues fill the surface highlighting the artist s new exploration of pigments that disperse in wet media To make this work Whitten used a hollow core door as his support providing him with a lightweight inflexible base avoiding the instability to which a canvas is prone Evoking his collages from the 1980s Whitten creates a stark contrast between figure and ground through texture and form placing three dimensional moulded acrylic elements ready nows across the composition To the centre left of the work Whitten horizontally positions red white and black pieces of acrylic recalling the flags of countries such as Egypt Syria Iraq and Yemen all of which share a similar design but bear a different crescent Created in 2011 this work is rooted in both personal experience and historic significance In January 2001 Whitten travelled to Egypt and was captivated by the breadth of shops selling pigments and spices There he purchased indigo pigment to experiment with which is readily apparent in this work Notably the properties of the pigment align with Whitten s experimental practice derived from a plant the brilliant blue colour only develops after it has been extracted and oxidised Building on this Egyptian Indigo was conceived in response to the Arab Spring a series of pro democracy protests that enveloped North Africa and the Middle East between December 2010 and December 2012 This aligns with Whitten s wider practice as he often referenced reflected on and memorialised important historical events as well as people he admired through his art which in turn functioned as a kind of present day history painting 1 His subjects ranged from Miles Davis and Malcolm X to the September 11 attacks and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting In each of these depictions Whitten strives to capture the essence of his subjects through abstraction creating a collective memory He stated Abstraction as we know it can be directed towards the specifics of subject a person a thing an experience My goal is to use painting to build abstraction as a symbol 2 Taken as a whole this work speaks to Whitten s ceaseless innovation it not only demonstrates his outstanding contribution to the development of painting but also offers a poignant reflection on the international political landscape of the time Jack Whitten quoted in Kathryn Kanjo Robert Storr Quincy Troupe Jack Whitten Five Decades of Painting San Diego CA Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego 2015 p 23 Alexander Gray Jack Whitten Jack Whitten New York NY Alexander Gray Associates 2013 p 3

Olafur Eliasson has created a large expensive Sculpture on silvered coloured glass (rainbow spectrum), composite board in the modern year of 2021.0 Olafur Eliasson s sculpture Spatial orbit 2021 highlights modes of perception and the illusion of dimension within two dimensional physical space Building upon Eliasson s ongoing engagement with mirrors and his observation that an ellipse is simply a circle viewed in perspective this work employs forms that mimic overlapping colored discs rotating on their own axes Viewed as a whole the forms come together to shape either a spectrum akin to a color wheel Here groups of laminated and silvered colored glass mirrors seemingly overlap to create new darker hues at their intersections As the rotating discs or ellipses become narrower the elements begin to separate from one another revealing the surface that they are mounted on With this optical play of light reflection and color Eliasson furthers his exploration of fundamental interactions of the visible light spectrum on geometric planes

Renata Lucas has created a medium nominal Sculpture on tiles, newspaper, mdf in the classic year of 2017.0 Urban surface and its layers and boundaries are preoccupations of Renata Lucas For Lucas the architecture and passages of a city are a provisional fabric containing social histories which she works to uncover The artist most often explores this through site specific and participatory works In Folding tectonics June 28th 2017 2017 a folded tile floor partially conceals a page of The New York Times from June 28th 2017 where the words a broken social ladder discord emerges on and Democracy can be read In her reference to tectonics and use of the tile floor Lucas alludes to massive plates of the earth beneath our feet which appear solid but are in fact an unstable body A newspaper a signifier for society s values and politics is here enveloped by this ground suggesting the provisional nature of that which we think we stand on

Callum Innes has created a large expensive Painting on oil on linen in the classic year of 2018.0 Callum Innes creates abstract paintings that carry a powerful tension between control and fluidity Untitled Lamp Black No 25 offers an intriguing pairing of black and black which invites the viewer to closely examine the artist s technique and tactility of the medium Dissolution is central to his practice layers of deep pigments are brushed over with turpentine breaking down sections of paint and leaving watery trace elements before being painted over again Repeating this process of painting dissolving and repainting multiple times Innes builds depth and a sense of history oblique panels of dense pigments become embedded and fortified while tiny trickles or rivulets of liquified paint point to their underlying fragility Though Innes works may seem minimal or geometric at first glance they are in fact always slightly off kilter governed by imperfectly drawn lines and slightly softened shapes This fallibility and humanity put in contrast with the artist s skill and precision as a painter results in works of great poetic and contemplative power cementing Innes place as one of the most significant abstract painters of his generation Callum Innes has been the subject of solo exhibitions at De Pont Museum Tilburg Kunsthalle Bern Neues Museum N rnberg Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney the ICA London the Scottish National Gallery and the Fruitmarket Gallery Edinburgh Kettle s Yard Cambridge Modern Art Oxford the Whitworth Manchester IMMA Dublin and recently at Ch teau La Coste Provence 2018 His work can be found in the collections of Albright Knox Buffalo Centre Pompidou Paris Irish Museum of Modern Art Dublin Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth Texas Muse des Beaux Arts Lausanne National Galleries of Australia Canberra San Francisco Museum of Modern Art CA Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Edinburgh Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York and TATE Gallery London 
Sarah Grilo has created a medium cheap Work on Paper on Oil on paper in the classic year of 1993.0 Born in Buenos Aires in 1917 Sarah Grilo began her early studies in painting with the renowned Spanish artist Vicente Puig Grilo lived in Argentina France and Spain before receiving a J S Guggenheim Fellowship in 1961 and subsequently moved to New York At her arrival in NY the Buenos Aires born artist felt the need to inject reality into her painting and the certainty that she felt she was in the right place at the right time to take the leap New York of the fifties had become the new hub of the international art scene and its streets were a creative haven for a generation of artists beckoned to push the limits of art In 1962 the same year that Grilo arrived in the city Warhol created his first screen print Oldenburg exhibited his soft sculptures Kusama surprised everyone with her accumulations and Judd blurred the notion of originality by creating objects that could be redone without losing their artistic condition Grilo would come to absorb the strategies and technical resources of the new avant garde from a stance of independence and creative freedom Her status as a female artist from abroad with limited command of the language fuelled in her the idea of translating and transposing reality to the picture plane through the discursive use of language Soon her canvases began to fill up with words signs and inscriptions that she found in adverts in Life Magazine in headlines in newspapers such as the New York Times and in the graffiti lining the walls of the city s buildings Words and numbers jumbled together and partially fragmented by glazes of paint turned each canvas into a collage of meaning and brand new connections that would create a talking point on the real effects of publicity and political discourse at the time as can be seen in At Macy s from 1965 Grilo left New York in 1970 and headed for Europe having amassed an extraordinary wealth of pictorial vocabulary Each painting hides resources and solutions that add up to a creative and vital universe that does not conform to any particular evolutionary or chronological style parameters They are works born from a deprived need for programmatic artifice seducing the spectator from their own pictorial condition Grilo has held both solo and group exhibitions at numerous galleries and institutions in the United States Latin America and Europe These include Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof a Madrid Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes Buenos Aires Museo de Bellas Artes Caracas Instituto de Arte Contempor neo Lima Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation CIFO Miami Art Museum of the Americas Washington D C Nelson Rockefeller Collection New York Blanton Museum of Art Austin Stedelijk Museum of Art Amsterdam or Museo Espa ol de Arte Contempor neo Madrid among others Most recently Grilo s work was shown at the Museum of Modern Art s MoMA groundbreaking 2017 exhibition Making Space Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction

George Rickey has created a large nominal Sculpture on stainless steel in the classic year of 1990.0 Born in 1907 in South Bend IN George Rickey spent over five decades committed to the creation of poetic and precisely calibrated sculptures that he referred to as his useless machines Designed to be situated in the public sphere the works are activated by their interplay with the surrounding environment reshaping the landscape and bringing heightened attention to aspects of light movement and composition Of all the natural forces it was the wind s movement that most captured Rickey s imagination He once wrote The artist finds waiting for him as subject not the trees not the flowers not the landscape but the waving of branches and the trembling of stems the piling up or scudding of clouds the rising and setting and waxing and waning of heavenly bodies After initially studying painting in Paris Rickey returned to the US in 1930 and his career as a painter and muralist developed in the 30s and early 40s completing works through the WPA and other public commissions It was during his Army Air corps War service that he rediscovered his long dormant natural aptitude for mechanics Already in the mid 30s he had seen Calder s exhibition of mobiles in New York however it was during the War that his thinking about a new and different kind of art began to shift While familiarizing himself with gyroscopes on B 29 gunnery sights other important memories were engaged from his youth that would have bearing on his artistic life s work as a kinetic sculptor such as the knife edge gimbal that kept the compass and stove level on his family s yacht growing up in Scotland and the simple mechanics of a pendulum seen in his grandfather s clock making shop as a young boy In his war years during free time in the workshop he started experiments at first with Calder esque mobiles and then little machines later other sculptures would be inspired by the movement of flowers sedges the clouds and stars in the wind Soon afterward Rickey began to devote himself to the investigation of motion in sculpture producing dynamic works using simple geometric forms such as lines squares rectangles circles etc in which his prodigious understanding of engineering and mechanics is demonstrable Though the works enthusiastically collaborate with the interference of wind currents in their environment the speed of their random movements are tempered by simple spacing and fixed arrangement of the elements The relationship of the parts remains the same but the dance is always changing It is this tension that defines Rickey s sculptures I think it s important to make art that you have to wait for said the artist As such the works are able to oscillate gracefully through an infinite number of compositional iterations engaging all aspects of the natural world around them wind light rain fog or the lack thereof Much of Rickey s work was created in his studio in East Chatham New York where he settled in 1960 Prior to that time the artist had lived and taught in Bloomington IN New Orleans LA New York NY and throughout the Midwest His childhood youth and college years were spent in Scotland and Britain Aside from East Chatham he had studios in Berlin Germany and Santa Barbara CA His work is included in the permanent collections of over 150 museums worldwide including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Smithsonian Institution Washington D C Los Angeles County Museum of Art California Museum of Modern Art New York Metropolitan Museum of Art New York National Gallery of Art Washington D C Walker Art Center Minneapolis National Gallery of Scotland Edinburgh Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Rotterdam and Kunstmuseum Bern Switzerland among many others Key exhibitions include George Rickey Monumental Sculptures on Park Avenue New York 2021 A Life in Art Works by George Rickey Indianapolis Art Center Indiana 2009 George Rickey Kinetic Sculpture A Retrospective Vero Beach Museum of Art Florida Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park Grand Rapids and McNay Art Museum San Antonio 2007 09 George Rickey Kinetische Skulpturen Museum f r Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg Germany 2003 and George Rickey Retrospective Exhibition Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York 1979

Markus Lüpertz has created a large expensive Painting on Mixed media on canvas in artist's frame in the modern year of 2020.0 Professor Markus L pertz b 1941 Liberec former Bohemia lives and works in D sseldorf and Berlin is a highly accomplished German painter and sculptor and has been exhibiting his work worldwide for over fifty years Markus L pertz has consistently challenged the norms of contemporary art L pertz s ideas and inspiration are often rooted in the history of painting his first mature paintings addressed pop imagery and developed ideas of abstraction and pictorial invention through theme and variation his German Motif paintings of the 1970s tackled major themes of post war German identity a subject many considered to be taboo In the 1980s L pertz used his art to re examine the importance of narrative in painting while many of his contemporaries were occupied with a then emerging postmodernism Merging this interest in both art history and narrative Arcadia is the central theme of his recent works Here L pertz focuses on classical themes as the source for an intense exploration Adam finds its origin from one of Jacopo della Quercia s important bas relief sculptures The Creation of Adam ca 1424 35 made from Istrian stone for the Basilica di San Petronio in Bologna Here L pertz transposes Adam from della Quercia s 15th century scene into a verdant yet shadowy setting retaining Adam s exaggerated musculature with a palette of grays and blacks that suggest classical statuary L pertz then decisively fragments the plane in two via a masking technique sequestering the figure from the Arcadia so lushly depicted on the other side of the picture As art historian Eric Darragon writes in his essay Mythologies Adam is depicted alone in the pose of someone waiting his arm poised to receive the forbidden fruit He exists in a world apart from the one he will create a green but empty landscape where is place is unmarked 
Francis Picabia has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas  in the classic year of 1940.0 Francis Picabia 1879 1953 was one of the most influential forces in art of the 20th Century While deeply involved with Marcel Duchamp Andr Breton Jean Cocteau and other key artists writers and thinkers in the early 20th Century Picabia remained fiercely independent moving through a wide range of art movements including Cubist abstraction and Dadaism toward his own form of Surrealism Picabia would reinvent himself yet again in the mid 1930s and into the following decade creating the so called kitsch paintings Derived from photographs of Hollywood stars and images found in girlie mags of the times the kitsch paintings again demonstrate Picabia s willful disregard of convention in painting For decades these works were virtually ignored by critics and art theorists who deemed the works amateurish or insincere The enormous impact these works had on subsequent generations of artists is only now being considered Throughout his career Picabia maintained a passionate interest in and love of Spain He painted portraits of Spanish women throughout the 1920s and 1930s and returned to this theme later in his career with this portrait of Juan Belmonte 1892 1962 one of the greatest bullfighters in history Belmonte was renowned for his unusual technique where he would stand erect nearly motionless and remain as close to the bull as possible previous matadors stayed far away from their bulls Of his technique he said I went to the ring like a mathematician going to the blackboard to prove a theorem Belmonte was a close friend of Ernest Hemingway and appears prominently in the author s major works Death in the Afternoon and The Sun Also Rises It is through this connection that we can infer Belmonte may have personally encountered Gertrude Stein and Francis Picabia Picabia s portrait is from 1940 1941 over five years after Belmonte s retirement from the bullfighting ring During his career he received 24 serious wounds and countless minor ones developed a heart condition and was told he could no longer drink smoke ride horses or have sex Belmonte would have been nearly fifty at the time of Picabia s painting but the man depicted is a young handsome champion at the height of his career Picabia often worked from photographs and the subtext here of capturing a moment long past is quietly affecting

Gary Simmons has created a large expensive Painting on Oil and cold wax on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Over the past three decades Gary Simmons has developed a profound and energetic practice that explores notions of race class social stereotypes and politics through painting sculpture sound and architectural environments Considering the influence of the past upon the present Simmons work grapples with the unfixed nature of memory and the American penchant for revising personal and collective experiences Many of Simmons earlier works draw from cartoon imagery to investigate the dissemination of racial stereotypes through American media Simmons first appropriated cartoon characters in his renowned chalkboard drawings from the early 1990s which reference the Looney Tunes characters Bosko and Honey Introduced to movie theater audiences in 1930 these cartoon characters were caricatures of black Americans that were based largely on minstrelsy Simmons blurred rendering of these characters in his paintings lent them a ghostly and haunting appearance that echoes the way in which insidious media imagery lingers in the collective imagination Simmons later expanded his investigation of cartoon imagery into more general structures of American culture incorporating images of gazebos roller coasters amusement parks and other iconic symbols of a collective American experience into his works Hold Up Wait A Minute 2021 is a painting from Simmons newest body of work A haunting image of Bosko is set against a dark atmospheric background Simmons smudged rendering of the cartoon character who appears to be jumping or falling in mid air and the stars surrounding him give way to a sense of chaos and flux Three decades after his initial exploration into cartoons Simmons returns to the visual vocabulary of his earlier works the familiar imagery taking on new meaning within the context of today s society

Christina Quarles has created a large expensive Painting on Acrylic on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Christina Quarles b 1985 is a Los Angeles based artist whose practice explores and manifests new expressions of visibility in her painted subjects In works such as Ascent Quarles uses her signature process combining instinctive brushstrokes with carefully painted patterns mapping subjects onto a plane in distorted hyper real fashion leaving the viewer to grapple with any classification or identification of the subject Drawing on painting s vast stylistic catalog and politics of representation Quarles addresses the multiplicity and complexity of human identity These shifting and morphing bodies not only negotiate with the viewer s assumptions but with the limitations of the canvas itself Forms push towards the corners and edges of the canvas challenging the material terrain of the painting Figures give way to multiple limbs as the bodies become enmeshed and also react to one another caressing holding and physically supporting one another as they fill the canvas Planes of color and pattern circumscribe the figures building literal spaces like a lace covered table but also creating impossible limitations that exist only in the world of Quarles paintings

Robert Longo has created a large expensive Work on Paper on Charcoal on mounted paper in the modern year of 2021.0 Robert Longo b 1953 New York is known for his large scale hyper realistic charcoal drawings based on media imagery that reflect on the construction of symbols of power and authority The process of transposing an image from one medium to another is crucial for Longo a photograph is recorded in an instant he explains but a drawing takes months to make In doing so he slows down both the artist s and the viewer s relationship to the image allowing us to consume its full power In Untitled Samson 2021 the panther s head dominates the entire picture plane The steeliness of its gaze contrasts with the palpable softness of its fur which the artist has rendered in meticulous detail while the delicate chiaroscuro exposes at once the fragility of the medium and the vulnerability that lies behind all images of power

Callum Innes has created a large expensive Painting on oil on linen in the modern year of 2020.0 Callum Innes creates abstract paintings that carry a powerful tension between control and fluidity Dissolution is central to his practice layers of deep pigments are brushed over with turpentine breaking down sections of paint and leaving watery trace elements before being painted over again Repeating this process of painting dissolving and repainting multiple times Innes builds depth and a sense of history oblique panels of dense pigments become embedded and fortified while tiny trickles or rivulets of liquified paint point to their underlying fragility This meticulous approach to materials is carried across into the artists watercolours and pastels in which pigment is built up into velveteen layers Though Innes works may seem minimal or geometric at first glance they are in fact always slightly off kilter governed by imperfectly drawn lines and slightly softened shapes This fallibility and humanity put in contrast with the artist s skill and precision as a painter results in works of great poetic and contemplative power cementing Innes place as one of the most significant abstract painters of his generation Callum Innes has been the subject of solo exhibitions at De Pont Museum Tilburg Kunsthalle Bern Neues Museum N rnberg Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney the ICA London the Scottish National Gallery and the Fruitmarket Gallery Edinburgh Kettle s Yard Cambridge Modern Art Oxford the Whitworth Manchester IMMA Dublin and recently at Ch teau La Coste Provence 2018 His work can be found in the collections of Albright Knox Buffalo Centre Pompidou Paris Irish Museum of Modern Art Dublin Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth Texas Muse des Beaux Arts Lausanne National Galleries of Australia Canberra San Francisco Museum of Modern Art CA Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Edinburgh Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York and TATE Gallery London

Lee Krasner has created a small expensive Work on Paper on gouache on Howell paper in the classic year of 1969.0 Lee Krasner is considered one of the most critical figures in the evolution of American art in the second half of the 20th century Emerging from the first generation of Abstract Expressionist painters Krasner committed to a six decade persistent exploration of novel approaches to painting and collage Born in New York to a Russian Orthodox Jewish family Krasner pursued a formal art education at several institutions in New York including the Women s Art School of Cooper Union the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League In 1937 Krasner began taking classes with Hans Hofmann who would radically influence her mature abstract style Throughout the 1930s and 40s Krasner became fully engaged in the New York art scene and integrated herself into contemporary circles that included Jackson Pollock whom she married in 1945 Though an established artist already before she met Pollock Krasner s relationship with the talented yet troubled painter long overshadowed her own artistic vocation Arguably the most crucial proponent of Pollock Krasner was instrumental in propelling his career and cementing his reputation as the most influential living American artist having introduced him to Willem de Kooning Clement Greenberg and Peggy Guggenheim as well as other key figures Living with Pollock at their home near The Springs Long Island Krasner developed some of her most compelling series including her Little Image paintings Defined by thick impasto and repetitive abstract symbols these works are recognized as among her most noteworthy contributions to Abstract Expressionism Following Pollock s death from an automobile accident in 1956 Krasner dedicated the remainder of her life to solidifying Pollock s legacy while continuing her own artistic endeavors During this time of newfound solitude Krasner realized her iconic Umber Paintings which convey a distinctive rawness and intensity that was unprecedented in her oeuvre until this point Fiercely composed of abstract forms through explosive brushwork in a parsed down palette of primarily umber cream and white this series is considered among Krasner s most psychoanalytically evocative work With paintings from the 1960s Krasner embraced Pollock s artistic achievements in size all over composition gestural method and engagement with Jungian psychology which emphasized the importance of the individual psyche and personal quest for wholeness From time to time Krasner incorporated staring eyes a motif that harkened back to her own earlier work Other repeated marks suggest foliage wind feathers and wings It is with these works that Krasner further delved into ideas about self knowledge Reflecting on work from this period in 1973 Krasner remarked My painting is so biographical if anyone can take the trouble to read it This assertion is evident especially in works from the 1960s which stand as vehicles by which the artist confronted her turbulent 11 year relationship with Pollock and the effects of his death in a particularly poignant and personal mode of expression At once unruly and lyrical each canvas becomes animated by Krasner s individual and newly powerful backhand gesture advancing in a rhythmic motion from right to left in vast curvilinear sweeps Vigorously thrusting and stabbing with her brush and body these works present Krasner s sophisticated integration of sprays and arcs with nodules of paint Accordingly Krasner s works from the 1960s signal her emergence from behind her husband s shadow and the beginning of Krasner s critical recognition of her own unique and noteworthy artistic impulses Krasner s work is held in the permanent collections of major institutions worldwide such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York Museum of Modern Art New York Jewish Museum New York Whitney Museum of American Art New York Brooklyn Museum New York Albright Knox Art Gallery Buffalo National Gallery of Art Washington D C Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Washington D C Tate London Cleveland Museum of Art Los Angeles County Museum of Art Kleefeld Contemporary Art Museum Long Beach Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles Philadelphia Museum of Art National Gallery of Australia Sydney Glenstone Museum Potomac Maryland and the Artizon Museum Tokyo Japan among many others 
Liam Everett has created a large nominal Painting on ink, oil, sand on primed linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Liam Everett s abstract mixed media painting and sculpture result from a process of steadfast and repetitious application and erasure employing non traditional methods to apply and caustic substances to remove painstakingly developed layers of paint and composition Inspired by the dynamic alchemy of the natural environment in California this method makes plain the interactive properties of the substances on the canvas how they counteract preserve or react to one another In this way Everett s investigative procedure laser focused on the subtle behavior of his materials becomes akin to the scientific assaying of chemical and mineral substances in order to determine purity or the limits of stability In the studio the artist develops this process by imposing physical obstructions demanding exaggerated levels of adaptation and effort that recall the straight faced farce and gesturality of absurdist theatre Everett brings the body into the problem solving inherent in art making destabilizing and actualizing all at once The studio space then is akin to a rehearsal space in which progression and perpetual motion never quite reach a reliable resolution The toil of this circuitous working method is imbued in the work revealing itself on the canvas as a complex material and metaphysical depth The distillation of the studio s physical and ephemeral characteristics constitutes an important aspect of the artist s practice That which finds expression as work on canvas originates as the inherent dimensions of the structure of the space the proportion of a window direction of its light and the makeshift tools found nearby or inside Time spent in the studio corralling these native elements and learning their individual insistences on translation through the work acts as Everett s primary vehicle for developing its direction In this way what remains is an indexical record of the artist s labor and practice Everett has previously collaborated with choreographers and dancers during major exhibitions to activate the motion inherent in the works For the artist s 2017 installation at SFMOMA Everett invited dance partners for performative actions twice weekly incorporating a sculptural staging element that further developed his investigations into the influence of emotive environments Born in 1973 in Rochester New York Liam Everett lives and works in Northern California His work has been included in exhibitions at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art the Biennale of Painting Museum Dhondt Dhaenens Deurle Belgium U C Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts San Francisco Everett is the recipient of the SECA Art Award at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 2017 the Richard Diebenkorn Teaching Fellowship at the San Francisco Art Institute 2013 and the San Francisco Artadia Award 2013 Everett s work is included in significant international public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Dallas Museum of Art Mus e des Beaux Arts Rennes France Fondation Carmignac Paris Kistefos Museum Jevnaker Norway and U C Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive 
Elliott Hundley has created a large nominal Painting on encaustic, paper, plastic, pins, photographs, foam and linen on panel in the modern year of 2021.0 Elliott Hundley expands the traditional notions of collage and assemblage in a multidisciplinary practice of painting drawing sculpture and photography that synthesizes ancient epics futuristic narratives and contemporary realities The resulting works resemble theatrical landscapes that delve into the artist s psyche reflecting Hundley s desire to create a new personal mythology Moving fluidly across media the artist utilizes found materials as various as bamboo polystyrene steel embroidered fabric and ceramics Works on canvas are constructed from layers of meticulously compiled source material and mixed media elements affixed using industrial fabric pins frequently shaped by painterly marks that recall the sweeping dynamism of gestural abstraction Often these works include text fragments a boisterous medley of voices both literary and colloquial The results evoke operatic backdrops battle advancement maps or montages of the eternal present What from a distance appears as a tangled frenzy of color and form is revealed on closer inspection as a scrupulously organized ecosystem of smaller scale components much like a city seen from above in the darkness The gradual accumulation of imagery for an initially undetermined use is a critical element of the artist s process At his studio in Los Angeles Hundley presides over a vast archive of two and three dimensional materials collated from books magazines and establishments in his local neighborhood Categorized alphabetically and according to color or mood these materials are brought into dialogue with Hundley s own photography of his family and friends whom the artist dresses and directs as if characters from a play While some are evidently protagonists constituting a focal point on the canvas others lay among dense folds of visual information assuming the role of a face in a crowd or phantom figures arising from unknowable depths Hundley leverages an abiding knowledge of classical mythology and literature to weave a fabric of allusions informing projects such as his 2011 solo exhibition at the Wexner Center for the Arts Ohio which travelled to the Nasher Sculpture Center Dallas and took on the Ancient Greek tragedy The Bacchae by Euripides as its subject matter In 2006 the artist s installation at the Hammer Museum Los Angeles referenced Greek figures Aphrodite Medea and Penelope and 2016 17 Hundley presented solo exhibitions based on Antonin Artaud s surrealist 1933 play There Is No More Firmament His first solo exhibition at Kasmin scheduled for September 2021 takes its inspiration from Jean Genet s 1957 play The Balcony In 2019 Hundley inaugurated the exhibition series Open House at MOCA Los Angeles exploring how the visual and material logic of collage has informed artists in MOCA s collection as well as his own practice In Fall 2021 Hundley will unveil a new 40 ft mural as part of contemporary art triennial Prospect New Orleans Elliott Hundley s work is included in significant international public collections including The Broad Los Angeles CA DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art Athens Greece Hammer Museum Los Angeles CA Istanbul Museum of Modern Art Turkey Los Angeles County Museum of Art CA Louisiana Museum of Modern Art Humleb k Denmark Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles CA Museum of Modern Art New York NY Nasher Sculpture Center Dallas TX P rez Art Museum Miami FL San Francisco Museum of Modern Art CA Solomon R Guggenheim Museum New York NY Vancouver Art Gallery Canada Walker Art Center Minneapolis MN and the Whitney Museum of American Art New York NY

Jörg Immendorff has created a large expensive Sculpture on Fire-gilded bronze in the classic year of 2001.0 J rg Immendorff 1945 2007 is one of the most influential German artists of the 20th Century known for a body of work that challenged both artistic and political establishments He is most celebrated for his Caf Deutschland artworks from the late 70s and early 80s which depict a conceptual cabaret nightclub space in which a disparate cast of cultural and political characters could convene and interact At Caf Deutschland the complexities of a divided Germany could be explored and reconciled Similar to how Immendorff would hide historical figures and motifs in his Caf Deutschland paintings his late works feature an amalgamation of iconic art historical motifs that have influenced the artist s life and career This figure Nude Walking on Balls comes from a drawing by Hans Baldung Grien that is currently in the collection of the Albertina Vienna This figure appears in many of Immendorff s paintings from the early 2000s and even became one of the artist s few sculptures in 2001 The almost alchemical process of fire gilding is notable here as it is a dangerous procedure to cast this work Immendorff dissolved gold into mercury creating a mixture that is spread onto the bronze base The mercury is then boiled off although this may pose a risk of mercury poisoning to an unprepared sculptor the process also leaves a gold coating on the sculpture that can be burnished into a smooth shiny surface Since the mid 1960s Immendorff exhibited regularly throughout Germany Early on he participated in documenta V in 1972 and was included in the Venice Biennial in 1976 From that time gained further exposure throughout Europe and internationally Important exhibitions include Museum Boymans van Beuningen Rotterdam Municipal Museum The Hague Museo Rufino Tamayo Mexico City Kunstmuseum Bonn Kunsthalle D sseldorf Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin and Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven among many others In 2007 Museum Kunst Palast D sseldorf organised a sweeping survey of the artist s drawings In 1998 Immendorff was awarded the highly distinguished Order of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany Immendorff lived and worked in D sseldorf and Hamburg until his death in 2007

Ed Clark has created a large expensive Painting on Acrylic on canvas in the classic year of 2006.0 A poetic treatise on the materiality of paint The Flag 2006 demonstrates Ed Clark s distinctive approach to abstraction and his mesmerizing use of color Sitting against a raw canvas two powerful surges of sky blue and fiery red traverse the surface in broad gestural strokes that are emblematic of his large scale works from this decade Closer inspection reveals chestnut brown and warm orange tones emerging from the sweeps of color which fade into white toward the center of the painting Taken as a whole these dynamic horizontal marks resemble a flag billowing in the wind evoking the work s title and reinforcing the fluidity of the striking composition Born in Louisiana and raised in Chicago Clark spent many of his formative years as a young artist in France Encountering the art of Paul Ce zanne Henri Matisse and in particular the slab like paint surfaces of the French Russian born painter Nicolas de Sta l Clark began to ingeniously combine aspects of European modernism and American post war abstraction 1 In the late 1960s Clark began working on the floor using a push broom as a giant paintbrush He would pour several layers of acrylic paint onto unprimed canvas and then use the broom to spread it out As art historian Kellie Jones notes this captured not only the motion of the hand and arm but also the power of the body 2 For Clark the consistency and versatility of acrylic paint which could be applied thickly or thinly together with its quick drying nature lent itself to the speed with which he liked to work This technique produced a sense of drive within his paintings that is evident in The Flag the momentum of his sweeping gesture extends across the entire surface allowing him to blend multiple colors in a single stroke Over the course of seven decades Clark s experimentations with abstract form pure color and the physicality of paint yielded an oeuvre of remarkable originality furthering the language of American abstraction with renewed cogency The artist s practice defies the discreet categories of gestural and hard edged abstraction instead masterfully interweaving both into a unique form of expressionism The Flag is an outstanding example of Clark s ability to sweep his medium into an atmospheric emotive and exuberant visual field 1 John Yau A History Waiting to Be Written Ed Clark s High Spirited Abstract Paintings in David Hammons Ed Clark Big Bang New York NY Jack Tilton Gallery 2014 p 10 2 Kellie Jones Energy Experimentation Black Artists and Abstraction 1964 1980 New York NY Studio Museum in Harlem 2006 p 21

Marsha Cottrell has created a medium nominal Work on Paper on Laser toner on paper, unique in the classic year of 2012.0 Marsha Cottrell s monochrome abstractions transcend the quotidian office computer and printer used in their making In playful exchange with her chosen medium the artist nudges mathematically defined lines and shapes grabbed from the software s tool palette across the field of the screen registering the intangible information in multiple passes of carbon based toner using a laser printer as one might a paintbrush There is no corresponding digital file for each unique image instead the paper is the canvas onto which each decision is materially preserved Translucent layers of ultra fine dust are fused with heat and pressure interacting with the subtle coarse texture of each handmade sheet to create rich tactile surfaces Cottrell s inventive process embraces and runs in opposition to an analytical working environment originally designed to speed productivity and increase the volume of output Schematic vector information gives way to space and light resuscitating the corporeal Cottrell s emphasis on the role of the body she is quick to point out that printer toner is carbon based is underscored by a work in which she imprinted her hands on two sheets of paper covered in toner She stopped the printer midway through its process after the toner had been applied but before it had been heat fused to the paper This bold assertion of the artist s body and authorial agency is an undercurrent in Cottrell s practice She makes ingenious use of technology but at cross purposes for example by running carefully selected handmade paper through a printer numerous times in order to build up compositions layer by layer Speed and efficiency are precisely not the point But significantly she does not take a proverbial bat to her plastic and metal collaborators Hers is not a project of undermining but of exploring 
John Wesley has created a small nominal Work on Paper on Gouache on paper in the classic year of 1999.0  Wesley has managed to assemble an enormous international constituency of devotees without once attracting the silly glare of paparazzo adulation the resentful hysteria of political acrimony or the cloudy glaze of educational explanation In fact Wesley s continuing vogue as a painter is in its every aspect more closely akin to that of a great jazz musician or song writer than to that of an American artist In the enclave of enthusiasts he is simply John Wesley an acknowledged master the Cole Porter of painting Those who know know those who care care those who don t know or care don t have a clue but that s okay too Dave Hickey Artforum
Anne Truitt has created a small expensive Work on Paper on Acrylic on paper in the classic year of 1972.0 Hailed as the first ever Minimalist by Clement Greenberg a term she refuted Anne Truitt s practice in sculpture painting and drawing generated a new language of abstraction Most known for her minimal and brightly colored totem like sculptures Truitt also made significant paintings during her lifetime that closely relate to her sculptural work in both form and color As Truitt explained I regard them the paintings as inflections of sculpture revealing the transcendent potential of geometric abstraction The palette of Truitt s 1970s work dominated by colors traditionally gendered as feminine can be seen as a provocative rejection of the austerity of Minimalism Of her paintings Truitt said A force is only visible in its effect and it is the split second in which this effect becomes just barely visible that haunts me Truitt s intuitive use of color and compositional techniques set her apart from artists like Robert Morris and Donald Judd with whom she is often compared Truitt spent most of her adult life in Washington D C Her work has been the subject of three major museum retrospective exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art 1974 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Baltimore Museum of Art 1975 and at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden 1992 During her lifetime Truitt received numerous awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship and five honorary doctorates Her work is in the collection of many leading museums including the National Gallery of Art Washington D C the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York the Whitney Museum of American Art New York DIA Art Foundation New York and the Museum of Modern Art New York

Manuel Mathieu has created a medium nominal Painting on Acrylic, oil stick, chalk, charcoal, and tape on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 This self portrait by Manuel Mathieu reflects the artist s interest in memory and personal history as a way of mapping the internal landscape of the mind The image hovers in a visual space between figuration and abstraction Our will towards pareidolia invites us to construct the form of a face with eyes while Mathieu s other aesthetic interests in texture brush stroke impasto vs flat surfaces and the embedded meaning of mixed mediums are free to express a range of other concerns in the periphery The clouded amorphous almost liquid appearance of this image is a potent signifier of Mathieu s awareness that identity is a fluid and ephemeral thing connecting to events and places and people that no longer exist and were subjectively experienced in the first place The elements creating and contributing to our environment become the landscape of our minds Mathieu says and potentially end up only existing in our imagination

Su Su has created a large cheap Painting on Oil on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Deer Life is an oil painting by Chinese born Pittsburgh based artist Su Su who is renowned for creating fantastical dreamlike oil paintings that offer a new and unique understanding of intercultural exchange a jittery beautiful hybrid of mass media pop culture history and memory with the capacity to shape our understanding of our interconnected world The image on which this painting is based is evocative of a one hundred deer porcelain vase from China a common style of vase dating to the Qing dynasty period The original vases show deer frolicking in a natural landscape devoid of humans among trees with criss crossed branches The term hundred deer is intended to suggest an abundance of blessings rather than a specific reference to an exact number In Su Su s composition the ancient deer share the scene with cartoon images of Bambi playfully milling together around a Surreal landscape dominated by an image of Su Su herself By blending references to American cultural icons such as Walt Disney characters with images from Chinese art history such as these deer or peaches and flowers taken from artworks in institutional museum collections Su Su s works speak to the complicated and confusing experiences she has had as an immigrant to the United States The distorted swirling world of liquified pop iconographies and Chinese symbolism melting together with Su Su s face and body reflects her struggle with the misunderstandings that shape the way China and the United States understand and portray each other s cultures

Philip Guston has created a large   Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1978.0 Philip Guston s late paintings reveal a deeply personal world teeming with disparate objects The Desire 1978 belongs to a number of seminal paintings that open a window onto Guston s inner world by laying out fundamental elements from his universe In 1970 Guston shocked the art world when he unveiled a new body of work at the Marlborough Gallery New York which eschewed the abstract expressionist practice for which he was renowned for a return to figuration These new and strange tableaux depicted scenes of unsettling disorder a narrative realism that distorted everyday reality into something unfamiliar and complex Guston s critics and followers found themselves at a loss to explain these radical paintings balanced somewhere between the comic and the grotesque Today Guston s cartoonish paintings from the 1970s are considered his greatest and most lasting contribution to art history Reconciling imagery and themes from his early oeuvre with the painterly qualities of his lush abstractions Guston s late works radically synthesize modes of painting previously deemed diametrically opposed by dogmatic critics and artists Painted in 1978 just two years before Guston s death The Desire exemplifies the artist s late figurative style The canvas is divided into two swathes of red and blue The bold horizon line an important visual motif of Guston s in 1977 and 1978 doubles as a tabletop upon which rests a highball glass with ice cubes and a sleeved arm that terminates in a clenched fist Like so many of Guston s figurative paintings The Desire externalizes intense inner turmoil through weighty symbols Hands whether pointing balled into fists or holding cigarettes frequently figure in Guston s paintings In The Desire the tension in the fist and the veins clearly visible beneath the skin suggest an existential conflict of epic proportions between the desire to drink and the desire not to drink the alcohol in the glass A 1979 painting by the artist Highball depicts the tumbler on the same red plane without the contextualization provided by a human hand the highball becomes a somber monument Guston s daughter Musa Mayer included an image of The Desire in her memoir of her father Night Studio The painting appears in a chapter exploring Guston s time in the Benedictine Hospital in Kingston New York where he was hospitalized for a heart attack In light of Guston s hallucinations at the hospital the doctor suggested that the artist was suffering from delirium tremens which led Mayer to wonder about her father s drinking habits Seeking answers in his studio she was struck by two paintings Head and Bottle 1975 which depicts Guston s cyclopean eye staring down at an empty green bottle and The Desire She wrote In The Desire painted only a year before a fist lies on a high red wall clenched as if to avoid clasping the highball glass behind it I knew he drank to calm his nerves and relieve pain she recalled Maybe alcohol was actually causing some of his awful swings of anxiety and depression rather than providing relief 1 Guston s honest examination of his inner life coupled with the artist s mastery of the painted medium has resulted in a powerful and intensely personal masterpiece of the 20th century 1 Musa Mayer Night Studio A Memoir of Philip Guston Munich and Berlin Germany Sieveking Verlag Zurich Switzerland Hauser Wirth Publishers 2016 p 259 260

Mark Ryden has created a large expensive Painting on oil on panel with carved and gilded wood frame in the modern year of 2021.0 Blending themes of pop culture with techniques reminiscent of the old masters Mark Ryden has devised a singular style that blurs traditional boundaries His work first garnered attention in the 1990s as he ushered in a new genre of painting Pop Surrealism which developed the scope and spirit of the 20th century surrealism by embellishing its vocabulary with contemporary cultural references Ryden s work exquisitely renders a universe replete with fantastical characters amid enchanted landscapes that embody the artist s meticulously realized signature blend of archetype kitsch and narrative mysticism Ryden s modern mythologies inseparably interweave twin senses of comfort and menace Most of my work engages with the relationship between the physical world and the spiritual world he has said His are scenes that exist in the ambiguous space between these two realms in which nostalgia and by extension memory even death are ever present This time honored artistic craftsmanship elevates heavily sentimentalized elements of American tradition and antiquity collected as though for a cabinet of wonders The labor intensive canvases deftly rework centuries of art history combining the grandeur of Spanish and Italian religious painting with the decorative richness of Old Master compositions and the lush textures of French Neoclassicism His ornately carved frames and meticulously glazed surfaces lend the paintings a baroque exuberance that adds gravity to their enigmatic themes Takashi Murakami has said Mark Ryden Yoshitomo Nara and I among others belong to a generation of artists who have been facing in the same general direction What I mean by the same direction is that as children we were baptized in subculture and that experience remains intensely imprinted on each of our beings When we subsequently began painting in our adolescent years we also started to study art history while simultaneously developing our painting technique Once we had full command of both of these we succeeded in combining historical painting methods with subculture That in a nutshell is our generation Ryden s collaboration with the American Ballet Theatre to reimagine Schlagobers the Richard Strauss libretto and score first performed at the Vienna State Opera in 1924 places Ryden within a rarefied tradition of visual artists in collaboration with dance With Whipped Cream Ryden joins an eminent cadre of artists who have designed sets and costumes for iconic ballet performances The Art of Whipped Cream was exhibited at Kasmin Gallery and at the Arnold and Marie Schwartz Gallery Met at the Metropolitan Opera House Mark Ryden received his BFA in 1987 from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena His paintings have been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide including a career spanning retrospective C mara de las maravillas at The Centro de Arte Contempor neo of M laga as well as an earlier retrospective Wondertoonel at the Frye Museum of Art in Seattle and Pasadena Museum of California Art Mark Ryden currently lives and works in Portland Oregon

Renée Green has created a large expensive Mixed Media on Custom wallpaper and custom upholstered wood chair in the classic year of 1993.0 During her residency in Clisson at the FRAC Pays de la Loire near Nantes Green began exploring the French region delving into the French history of the African slave trade She brought with her a bolt of toile she purchased in upstate New York which became a cypher for the connection between French colonialism slavery and the contemporary nation s inability to fully reckon with this history Nantes in particular was a city with a major share of the French slave trade from which much of its wealth was generated The city was also a major producer of toile in pre Revolutionary France This connected a particular form of the triangular trade slaves sold to colonies for cotton cotton sold to merchants for textiles toile among the most popular textiles used to purchase slaves The bedroom Green resided in at La Garenne Lemot in Clisson featured furniture upholstered in a toile with American colonial imagery and Green continued her research on the fabric and its historical gravity She asked herself What was the history of this pervasive fabric which in the U S could symbolize a mark of distinction and which in France could represent a prosaic simulation of the past on which situations open to narration appeared A fabric you could stare at and make conjectures about while falling asleep A storybook fabric Or was it more She produced the first Mise en Sc ne 1991 on occasion of the FRAC exhibition which was then acquired by the institution and shown at Pat Hearn Gallery in New York Based on her research in France regarding the toile industry and its role within the slave trade Green produced Commemorative Toile at the Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia used in the subsequent Mise en Sc ne exhibited in her touring museum show LA MOCA and Dallas Art Museum in 1993 and 1994 as well as the separate Commemorative Toile works thereafter The custom printed fabric and wallpaper appropriate the generic toile s idyllic construct infusing it with found images of the atrocities fictions and trauma of slavery They range from the only successful slave uprising in Haiti to the writing the Code Noir in the 17th century metropole as a chained slave across bears witness Said images are sourced from The Image of the Black in Western Art 1989 and Le Commerce de l Amerique par Marseille 1764 among others In the words of Alexander Alberro Green has the remarkable ability to construct a new type of history based entirely on the energies located in preexisting fragments An example a seemingly benign design depicts a scene from the 1823 novel Ourika by Claire de Duras in which a former slave girl is raised by French aristocrats based on a true story She is entirely unaware of the racial obstacles that would face her in European society until a ball is held in her honor and a guest declares that she could never marry because of her race Ourika in great pain sequesters herself to a monastery In Green s toile she is pictured in a nun s habit next to a Frenchman in front of the monastery as she recounts her story In Green s words But for those who don t know that story they can still enjoy a familiarly styled toile surface of entwining floral vines on their upholstery but which on closer viewing reveals in its gaps a strange fruit

enormous impenetrable walls all pointed critiques of US imperialism In 1989 Longo escaped a recession and the Gulf War by moving to Paris where he lived and worked for three years eventually returning

windows and a forest the eyes of a woman in a niqab and the reflection of clouds on a pilot s visor In 2014 following Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson Missouri and the declaration of an ISIS caliphate Longo began The Destroyer Cycle a series of works that distill scenes of power and violence from American media Riot police migrant ships and terrorist attacks form a searing portrait of a world locked in perpetual crisis For an exhibition at Metro Pictures in 2014 Longo presented a series of twelve charcoal drawings entitled Gang of Cosmos that functioned as black and white translations of well known paintings by Abstract Expressionists including Willem de Kooning Lee Krasner Jackson Pollock Ad Reinhardt Joan Mitchell and Mark Rothko thereby creating his own version of

In twelve parts. in the classic year of 2015.0 This year at Art Basel Miami Beach Michael Werner Gallery is pleased to present a selection of artworks by the Haitian American artist Andy Robert Robert gives his viewer a conceptual and visual framework to encounter the past in the present His method consists of gathering sitting with mapping plotting creating and collecting archives in order to interrogate systems of knowledge experience and emotion The twelve part Canal de Mona Mona Passage 2015 was made during an artist residency on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico The work was made en plein aire a method that is historically associated with 19th century French avant garde painting Like the Impressionists Robert initially removes himself from the studio with the ambition to more accurately capture the shifting and changing appearance of light While his practice is shaped by painterly sensibilities he enters the world with ulterior motives His underlying concerns are even more elusive than light Robert asks his viewer to reconsider the pastoral tropical scene and the Atlantic He confronts them with the obscured power of waves and ripples He visualizes the silences left in the wake of history of the Caribbean the conception of the New World and the larger postcolonial narrative He engages in investigations into the structures of lives and the symbolic economies that foster climates of uncertainty and inequality Images of migration displacement nationalism and exile emerge The absence of narration and the lack of linearity in Robert s paintings evade stimulating a direct emotional response from the viewer The works prompt a reflectiveness through eliciting senses of bereavement and loss Evoking the mystery that comes from not knowing what yearns at the horizon In being para Robert s examinations of the ripples of memory are probed by his lived experiences and his questions about the complex issues of historical time

Piero Manzoni has created a small expensive Mixed Media on Peluche in the classic year of 1961.0  My intention is to present a completely white surface or better still an absolutely colourless or neutral one beyond all pictorial phenomena all intervention alien to the sense of the surface A white surface which is neither a polar landscape nor an evocative or beautiful subject nor even a sensation a symbol or anything else but a white surface which is nothing other than a colourless surface or even a surface which quite simply is Piero ManzoniIn an era dominated by Abstract Expressionism and Art Informel Piero Manzoni radically dislocated the painted surface from the hand of the artist To achieve this end the series of Achrome works began in 1957 and lasted until his premature death in 1963 together constituting one of the most ground breaking and profound artistic contributions to the post war age In order to banish all narrative content pictorial colour was totally eliminated which is referenced in the title of the series a without chrome colour His works of art purged of any chromatic tone comprised layers of gesso while he later used materials as diverse as felt cotton polystyrene wool rabbit fur bread and stones The artist began the series by soaking his canvases in kaolin a component used in making porcelain Under the weight of the materials used by the artist these canvases obtained beautifully folded surfaces encouraging the viewer to focus on the physicality of the work In Manzoni s For the Discovery of a Zone of Images 1958 the artist stated that abstractions and references must be totally avoided He went on images which are as absolute as possible which cannot be valued for that which they record explain and express but only for that which they are to be Banishing pictorial content was not sufficient for Manzoni he also wanted to remove the hand of the artist He did this by allowing the Achromes to develop autonomously through the self defining drying process Germano Celant described this series as absolute as possible which cannot be valued for that which they record explain and express but only for what which they are to be In his search for form Manzoni was in influenced by the theories of such artists as Lucio Fontana and Alberto Burri although he also reacted against their work In 1957 Manzoni visited two exhibitions in Milan that were important for the development of his ideas an exhibition of work by Alberto Burri at Galleria del Naviglio whose Art Informel theories shared formal affinities with Manzoni s facture and method of automatism and Proposte monochrome Epoca blu by Yves Klein at the Galleria Apollinaire a display of 11 near identical monochrome blue paintings that proposed the potential for work that was tautological and self enclosed Manzoni began making his Achromes the same year In 1960 he would formulate his thoughts in a text entitled Free Dimension In this Manzoni wrote The question for me is that of creating an integrally white surface yes integrally colourless neutral which is completely unrelated to any pictorial phenomenon or to any element that is extraneous to the value of the surface It is a white that is not a polar landscape or a beautiful or evocative material or a sensation or a symbol or anything else it is a white surface that is nothing else but a white surface a colourless surface that is nothing else but a colourless surface During his brief life cut short at the age of only 29 Manzoni adopted a revolutionary conceptual approach to making and viewing art emphasising the surface and materials as the true subject of the work free from external influences and unhampered by associations He sought to liberate the surface of the canvas to discover total space to capture light itself and to become pure energy His Achromes were radical in their own self generating form laying bare their means and subject and achieving what Manzoni considered integral freedom The artist has achieved integral freedom pure material becomes pure energy all problems of artistic criticism are surmounted everything is permitted Piero ManzoniManzoni s Achrome 1962 is a work made from two strips of white plush fabric arranged in a rectangular composition As extraordinary example of Manzoni s seminal series this work marks a significant moment in the artist s career Abandoning the kaolin soaked canvasses in favour of a variety of banal materials often synthetic and industrially produced such as white plush fabric Manzoni advanced his interrogation of the formal and conceptual limits of painting Art historian Jaleh Mansoor noted the artist s Achrome series as one that evolved from formal Modernist principles one encounters the full schema of modernist painting First the modernist monochrome heavy with its historically determined purity and factual self evidence Alongside the monochrome stands its incommensurable counterpart the grid Manzoni s legacy is determined by both an affirmation and rejection of materiality as well as a simultaneous construction and deconstruction of formal and conceptual modernist templates 
Nicholas Galanin has created a small cheap Photography on digital photographic print in the classic year of 2013.0 In the work Ism No 1 Galanin juxtaposes iconic images from Tlingit and European traditions A photograph of a replica Tlingit shaman s mask is superimposed onto a crucifixion image from Christianity The shaman s mask functions as a connection to the supernatural world or a concrete connection to spirit while the Christ figure is representative of Christian belief in physical connection to the Christian god through a human body As Galanin describes During colonization and settlement Christian missionaries functioned as a wedge used to split apart Indigenous communities They forcibly replaced Indigenous creation stories knowledge and connection of spirituality in bodily experience with stories of suffering as the deserved result of evil ways of non Christian living Missionaries and residential schools violently attempted to destroy culture language and spiritual connection of Indigenous people to the land The shaman s mask over the crucified Christ can be read as theft of Indigenous culture and experience by a non Indigenous community This is also a strategy to use iconography understandable to a Eurocentric culture to make clear the level of suffering endured by carriers of Indigenous culture and to elevate the importance and significance of the shaman s mask to this audience

Lucio Fontana has created a small expensive Painting on Oil and sand on canvas in the classic year of 1957.0 At once disquieting and dreamy Lucio Fontana s body of work is inundated by the tensions which drive the elements of the work beyond the forms they occupy The overwhelming sense of coexisting creative and destructive components clearly relates to the amalgamation of pleasure and pain the true mark of the sublime Fontana s appreciation for the scientific advances of the twentieth century enabled his artistic development in this marriage of technology and art to produce a fourth dimension In his paintings Fontana sought foremost to eclipse the environs of the two dimensional surface and encroach upon the psychology of its viewers Concetto Spaziale translating literally to Spatial concept employs both planar shapes and biomorphic silhouettes amidst undulating curves The rough patches of brown contrast the monochromatic bleakness of the composition The fissures are not so much lacerations as they are sculptural construction an extension from a two dimensional surface Fontana acknowledges as a way of exposing the intangible sublime as he once proclaimed I have created an infinite dimension C Lonzi Interview with Lucio Fontana Autoritratto Bari Italy 1969 p 169 The picture itself is a constitutional fusion and rhythmic dance of sculpture architecture and painting an authentic apex of the artist s innovative aesthetic dialect Fontana s revolutionary concept of Spazialismo was the culmination of the fundamental precepts illustrated in his art The artist s dynamic ability to mutate solid matter into energy is unparalleled and it comprises the essence of his theory He formulated the comprehensive title Concetto spaziale in 1947 and used it for nearly all of his later art the most effective of these being works incisions rupturing a surface that preserves the elegantly erratic character of malleable organic materials such as wax or oil paint such as in the present lot Concetto spaziale utilizes contrasts as a point of departure to engage audiences in the struggle between the material and the spatial invoking the concept of painting as more than a simple surface 
Kennedy Yanko has created a large expensive Sculpture on Paint skin and metal in the modern year of 2021.0 This work by Kennedy Yanko was made for the Kabinett sector of Art Basel Miami Beach 2021 as part of Kavi Gupta s presentation The work reflects breakthroughs Yanko made during her 2021 residency with the Rubell Museum of Art in Miami Going into that residency Yanko had been working with her signature mix of found metal and poured paint skins for 12 years As an experienced welder Yanko was always very comfortable working with metal She felt like she was in a give and take relationship with the material where she could understand the history of the pieces she found and respect that while still exerting her will on the form Her relationship with the paint skins tended to be more intuitive The give and take was not with an existing form but with the material itself which interacts in unpredictable ways when introduced to the metal forms During the Rubell residency Yanko entered a new phase of her relationship with her paint skins one which centers the essential nature of the liquid medium organic movement Her installation for Kabinett consists of two metal pieces one smaller than the other Yanko describes them as siblings Each has black paint skins crawling on them Like black radionuclide dye in a bone cancer scan the black paint seems to be stabile and mobile at the same time an organic evolving element within the work The installation also represents an expansion of Yanko s interest in shadows and space She first visited the topic of expanding her sculptures into the exhibition space in her 2019 solo exhibition Hannah at Kavi Gupta s Elizabeth Street gallery in Chicago For that show she constructed painted and sculptural shadows on the floors and walls extending outward from the works I expanded the rust and dust colors into the space Yanko says That was when I began thinking about environment in intentional ways Now Yanko is wondering more about the internal aspects of a body s presence in space how can the projection of physical presence be considered when making the work It s more exploration around making a sculpture Yanko says starting to perfect certain things in the medium how I can manipulate it from outside

Davide Balliano has created a medium cheap Painting on Plaster, gesso and varnish on wood in the classic year of 2018.0  I think that my research lately seems to be focused on the power struggle between labor as human identity and the ferocious efficacy of technology passing through time and its perception and ending with the contemplation of the sublime Davide Balliano Contemporary artist Davide Balliano b 1983 was born in Turin and relocated to New York City in 2006 where he currently lives and works Within his artistic practice the artist s works exist in between the thin distinction of painting and sculpture Initially specialised in photography the artist transitioned his focus within the last decade onto painting and sculpture generating a significant body of work that has been exhibited in renowned galleries and exhibitions worldwide Balliano s characteristic minimal and geometric visual language finds striking results in the black and white surfaces that radiate a crispy perfection through the dynamic geometric composition of line and form Looking closely they reveal small imperfections scratches and scrapes within the plaster and gesso application on wood transforming the seemingly austere surface into a highly textured work that introduces a sculptural element to the work Interested in references drawing from a myriad of research fields such as the meaning of the iconised monument architecture and nature Balliano s body of work is the result of an ongoing confrontation with scientific and emotive concepts concerning the individual s relationship with the macrocosm

Nicholas Galanin has created a small cheap Photography on C-print mounted on Dibond in the classic year of 2012.0 The photograph Get Comfortable was shot in Galanin s home community As he describes The altered sign spray focuses the viewer on LAND a reminder that the land and people Indigenous to it remain connected regardless of the discomfort this may cause nations and communities built on colonial legacies of attempted genocide The work raises questions about comfort pointing to the lack of comfort afforded to Indigenous communities during the invasion of the Americas by colonial states and during the subsequent permanent settlement of the land The title Get Comfortable addresses communities that continue to disenfranchise and disregard Indigenous people asserting the continued presence of Indigenous life connected to the land Read by Indigenous communities standing next to the artist it is a reminder of presence as well of comfort gained from land of resistance to erasure of responsibility to land The work also acknowledges discomfort a reminder that Indigenous communities have not been comfortable for generations that cultural amnesia and cultural violence are maintained through the renaming of the land By intervening actively Galanin encourages presence resistance and re Indigenizing our concepts of place 
Nicholas Galanin has created a small cheap Photography on diptych, portrait of the artist; both halves of torn archival digital print in the modern year of 2019.0 This self portrait torn vertically in half one eye swollen black and blue reflects multiple layers of violence enacted through religious indoctrination and state enforcement of division between humans and non human animals and by further dividing humans from each other Half human animal references the dehumanizing language and policies used to justify genocide and violence towards Indigenous and non European people in the Americas The work s title asserts all humans as a single type of animal resisting non Indigenous epistemologies that espouse human supremacy and false moral division from non human life The work specifically targets Blood Quantum a colonial and settler legislated genocide against Indigenous communities The policy of tracking and measuring Indian Blood was and continues to be a fundamental tool in removing Indigenous people from legal claim to live farm hunt and fish on ancestral lands throughout North America Simultaneously African blood was tracked and measured down to a single drop not to erase the African but to retain oppressive claims of ownership under colonial and subsequently settler law The diptych is a record of Galanin s act of tearing his own image in two The internalization of Blood Quantum legislation by Indigenous people and communities causes Indigenous people of mixed heritage to tear themselves into pieces daily The work asserts that belief in and enforcement of the non Indigenous concept of Blood Quantum slowly erodes and erases connection to Indigenous Identity and culture and perpetuates violence while damaging the rights and responsibilities of people descended from Indigenous Nations After James Luna s Half Indian Half Mexican 1991

Jose Dávila has created a large nominal Painting on Silkscreen print and vinyl paint on loomstate linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Contradictory feelings of weight tension and levity run throughout Jose D vila s works Making use of materials in a way that pushes the limits of our perception he pairs incongruent elements that cause us to re examine the ways in which we understand what is at hand Taking inspiration from the ideals put in place by the 20th century avant garde Jose D vila re contextualises artists iconic artworks and raw materials Unexpected elements are brought into our focus The result is an elegant balancing act which feels almost atmospheric This series of paintings by Jose D vila are a variation of a previous body of work devoted to the geometric interpretation of the pictorial field within the canvas With these works D vila reveals the inner dynamics that shape the pictorial gestu re leaving brushstrokes and blocks of color in an assumably unpolished state and assembling a composition through the use of various patterns and vinyl paint on raw linen The works juxtapose circular elements appropriated and recontextualized from paintings by artists including Hans Arp Willys de Castro Sonia Delaunay and Frank Stella amongst others These paintings employ a unique procedure linking images found throughout art history from the 20 th and 21 st century which otherwise would not intersect enabling the viewer to generate personal connections bet ween what is seen and what is implied D vila s new paintings are focused on themes that prevail consistently throughout his practice a visual articulation of the force of gravity through precarious balance and a desire to draw attention to historical references that have particular mea ning for the artist Expanding upon these two concerns by incorporating the idea of circularity D vila has created new vocabulary with which to address themes of balance poetic intuition and poignant moments in the history of art

Jesper Just has created a medium cheap Photography on Pigment print on Hahnemühle paper in the modern year of 2021.0 Much of Jesper Just s practice is concentrated on the question of representation how do we create imagery and inversely how does this imagery then contributes to our ideas around bodies expectations identities social conventions and further more contributes to our sense of self Working primarily with the mediums of film photography and installation Jesper Just incorporates movement performance sound and beautifully subtle visual symbolism all of which comes together to create a deeply interactive and immersive environment Jesper Just is currently nominated for the prestigious ARS FENNICA Art Award which will be announced later this Spring With the Interpassivities and Corporealit s series five classically trained dancers have electrical wires attached to their limbs Their limbs contract and move not through the use of their bodies but through timed electro stimulations revealed to be directed by an accompanying musical score The wires both restrict but also enhance the body taking it a step away from something purely corporeal or rather a step away from what we consider to be the body in an ideal sense These ideas are also often echoed in the installation of works with fragmented LED screens and cement blocks placed strategically within the space crating world which feels both built and destroyed and the same time This added physical interaction or rather disruption alters the way you navigate the space and in so doing your perspective The work is an experience of intimacy and tactility in the wake of technology that increasingly replaces the human body The disciplined hyper capable ballet bodies are rendered relatively static while the devices attached to their limbs produce electrical currents that cause involuntary muscle movements The machine serves as the choreographer while the dancers remain immobile Through this juxtaposition Jesper conjures what Robert Pfaller and Slavoj i ek have called interpassivity or the potential within immobility There is a paradox in how we are interactive today We live in a full speed world in which we are constantly tranquilized by technology There are expectations about movement and choreography attached to the bodies of professional dancers but in puncturing those expectations Just ruptures social conventions of ableism and productivity as well Last images Jesper Just Circuits Interpassivities 2018 Installation view as part of the permanent collection at SMK The National Gallery of Denmark Copenhagen DenmarkPhoto credit Anders Sune BergJesper Just Corpor alit s 2020 Installation view at the ARS FENNICA Art Award exhibition at H meenlinaa Art MuseumPhoto credit Jussi Tiainen
Rasmus Myrup has created a large cheap Sculpture on Pine bark and pine cones from Odsherred, silk dress, athletic t-shirt, dress form, upholstery foam, wood, hardware in the modern year of 2021.0 Bringing together elements from our natural and social histories Rasmus Myrup s practice puts forward parallel narratives of what once was and what continues to be Love sex and power are brought into focus tying together the worlds of flora fauna and people alike Myrup s installations and sculptures reintroduce us to a world which is subversively ours but can be overtly ours if we so choose This drive to bring other narratives to the forefront is echoed in Myrup s technical prowess which utilises both traditional practices and modern techniques to create something which feels uniquely in the here and now This dynamic world is brought to life within the context of Folx Under this new fangled more inclusive spelling of the earthy traditional word folks sculptures in the form of figures from Danish folklore Scandinavian stories and Norse mythology inhabit the exhibition space Just as in their respective tales some known some forgotten each figure feels both human and other at the same time Echoing this duplicity each backstory is both incredibly detailed and vague refer ring to an abundance of tales both contradictory and similar Iconic elements from these stories are incorporated by Myrup into the sculptures with natural elements often sourced by Myrup from the places where the stories take place Fabricated or supposed differences between nature and culture are done away with as these figures often give explanations for how our world was physically created while their stories invoke cultural traditions which live long past our know ledge of why and how they came into being These folx might represent a wild and untamed nature that opposes any organized society but they are in fact pure creations of human culture Last image Rasmus Myrup Salon Des Refus s 2020 Installation view for the exhibition Witchhunt at Kunsthal Charlottenborg Copenhagen DenmarkPhoto credit David Stjernholm
Julie Lænkholm has created a medium cheap Mixed Media on Natural dyed wool on silk in the modern year of 2021.0 Julie L nkholm s practice has its roots in the ideas and the methods centred around collective learning Exploring techniques and practices which have been traditionally been passed down orally from generation to generation L nkholm activates a predominantly female driven history which has been forgotten or otherwise actively ignored As such she brings these narratives directly back into focus and places them within a contemporary discourse L nkholm s works are often textile in nature Using materials such as wool silk and denim she treats them with natural plant based dyes using historic methods each of which hold a certain significance and intentionality The specificity and the technical backdrop of this process comes through to create a very tactile three di mensional feeling that emanates from the work unlocking a kind of atmospheric presence that can be readily sensed Julie L nkholm s works bring us into a world where things feel as if they are in continual evolution almost as if the works remain alive long after they seem to be finished or in a final state We become participants of the work and in a way we activate the work while the work simultaneously acti vates us as well There is a generosity inherent in L nkholm practice Each thread and textile is presented in a way that imparts its process onwards and in so doing imparts the knowledge that is transmitted with it The connections and interaction with the works adds to this consciousness as we find ourselves becoming integrated into this collective learning process Last images Julie L nkholm The amethyst series 2021 Installation view at Galleri Nicolai Wallner Copenhagen DenmarkPhoto credit Anders Sune BergJulie L nkholm Panagamuwa 2018 Installation view of her solo exhibition Panagamuwa at Tranen Gentofte DenmarkPhoto credit David Stjernholm

Jeppe Hein has created a large nominal Mixed Media on Powder-coated aluminium, neon tubes, two-way mirror, powder-coated steel, transformers in the modern year of 2021.0 Jeppe Hein bases much of his practice on the relationships that exist between our internal consciousness and more physical elements Using minimal yet elegant materials that often reflect our own image as well as forms that playfully en courage us to move our bodies and to change positions Jeppe Hein creates an interactive and constantly changing dialogue between the spectator the work and the exhibition space that surrounds it His sculptures site specific installations watercolours and public works create environments in which we are encouraged to imagine new possibilities In so doing he challenges us to re think the ways in which our mind and our bodies are connected and to reflect on how we navigate through the metaphysical and physical worlds Jeppe Hein s ongoing neon series takes a very intimate approach to exploring the relationship between an artwork and our more spiritual or metaphysical sides a relationship that Jeppe has long been interested in The juxtaposition between the text which is quite direct and your own reflection as you stand in front of the piece creates a very unique space in which we are asked to think about what the phrase means to us WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES WHAT DO YOU SEE glows in white neon letters behind a two way mirror layered with reflections of the visitors and the surroun ding space Combined with the speech bubble shape and the two way mirror the appellative message seems to awaken viewers to the present moment question their sense of self and encourage them to wonder 
Kinga Bartis has created a medium cheap Painting on Charcoal on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Kinga Bartis approach to painting lies outside the boundaries of the classic school of painting Eschewing labels Bartis envisions painting as a means of brea king free from the habitual relationship of defining and redefining of our existen ce looking towards a more multidisciplinary and open approach Her painting In Between Bliss evokes a world in which floating bodies intertwine seamlessly with water shifting as we interact with the work ebbing and flow ing with us moving with us and against us Bartis works crate an energetic and deliberately ambiguous space which makes room for themes of sexuality power structures the body and self perception which can be felt throughout these moti ons as the pulsate towards us Their presence does not suggest a direction that Bartis wishes us to go in but rather a mood or a feeling a platform through which discussions are encouraged Last image Kinga Bartis Irregulars Beyond the Current 2021 Installation view from Galleri Nicolai Wallner Copenhagen DemmarkPhoto credit Anders Sune Berg
Jannis Varelas has created a large nominal Painting on oil, gouache, glue and gesso on canvas in the modern year of 2021.0 Jannis Varelas was born 1977 in Athens Greece lives and works in Athens and Los Angeles USA The Greek artist Jannis Varelas unveils the surprising side of banal elements in everyday life Playfully fusing abstraction and realistic representation his paintings explore lived spaces through a myriad of collage like details He constructs the reality from fragments like in archeological excavations lived moments are presented to us in a seemingly arbitrary composition of random traces We are shown a lighter lying on a packet of cigarettes a small stained cloth resembling the head of a mythical creature food leftovers shaped like a happy face when seen from a specific perspective these insignificant remnants suggest a different reality that can open up to a new dimension full of possibilities The signs and symbols in Varelas work resemble automatic painting or children s drawings with added dynamism deriving from the artist s highly physical expressive technique His work reflects on social issues and the plight of humanity in world history but the thematic content is expressed in a web of subtle allusions that spontaneously follow the artist s irrational trains of thought Varelas work has been exhibited widely around the world at venues such as the Palais de Tokyo in Paris London s Saatchi Gallery Benaki Museum Athens and the Kunsthalle Wien The artist divides his time between Los Angeles Vienna and Athens This work is part of a new series of paintings as the outcome of a process of performances and metamorphoses of the self With these works Varelas goes back to the images of the body exploring the gendered cultural representations of the human figure The artist chooses his models among his friends and neighbours and has them dressed specifically to be photographed in the specially laid out setting of his studio together with everyday objects from the Historical Collections of the Benaki Museum as well as seemingly unimportant or trivial objects from the fleeting wanderings of urban or domestic life The photographic rendering of the event provides the semantic raw material it is then transferred onto the canvas and transformed and diffracted by the language of painting 
Monica Bonvicini has created a large expensive Sculpture on aluminium, digital watches in the modern year of 2021.0 Monica Bonvicini born in Venice in 1965 studied at the University of the Arts in Berlin and the California Institute of Arts in Valencia From 1998 to 2002 she lived in Los Angeles where she taught at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena From 2003 to 2017 she was professor for performative art and sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna Monica Bonvicini has been a professor for sculpture at the University of the Arts in Berlin since 2017 In her multifarious practice Monica Bonvicini examines political social and institutional circumstances and their effects on society and art production In doing so she focuses on the relationship between architecture gender roles control mechanisms and power structures STAGECAGE is a play on words originated from the exhibition StageCraft at Columbia University and also the title of the new sculptures aluminium models of family houses Arranged in different constellation they echo the architectural installation As Walls keep Shifting 2019 Held together by leather belts decorated with knots of watches they create an uncanny narrativity that clashes against the exceptionally perfect and cool cuts of the aluminium structures It explicates Monica Bonvicini s artistic involvement with architecture and the intrinsic relationship it has to history memory and exertions of power The sculptures on mirror tables are both stage and staged they investigate the entanglement of place and identity making Bonvicini takes the act of building a house as an artistic exercise filling it up with feminist desires and witty fancies permanently shifting its forms and concepts The bare nature of the structure reveals both the beginning and the end of architecture both the metaphorical construction of all buildings as domestic habitual and socially regulating spaces Monica Bonvicini is the recipient of prominent international art prizes Among them are the Golden Lion from the Venice Biennale 1999 the Nationalgalerie Berlin prize 2005 and more recently the Oskar Kokoschka Prize 2020 Her works have been shown several times at many Biennales like the Venice and the Berlin Biennial the Busan Biennial the Quadriennale in Rome Aside from the numerous appearances of her art in national and international group shows comprehensive shows of her artwork have been seen at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art 2016 the 15th Instanbul Biennial 2017 the Belvedere 21 in Vienna 2019 the OGR Officine Grandi Riparazioni Turin 2019 Kunsthalle Bielefeld 2020 Galerie Krinzinger 2021 
A Kassen has created a large nominal Sculpture on Bronze in the modern year of 2021.0 Artist group A Kassen s practice is first and foremost an exploration of the relations hip between form and content Beginning with an object or an element such as an everyday object a material such as bronze or something more ephemeral like a puddle or a reflection A Kassen task themselves with acts of construction and de construction with reinterpretation and re contextualisation against the backdrop of questioning our preconceived notions of what the phenomenon in question really is Through these manipulations A Kassen create works that are necessarily meant to be seen through the context of art and aesthetics It is not so much a question of what happens when these works are placed within an institutional art setting but rather what happens when we take something that we have come to see as ordina ry or mundane and see it through the lens of art With this in mind the role of the spectator becomes central Conceived as an integral part of the work the specta tor becomes an interpreter creating layers of meaning and understanding for each of the works re writing their narratives Relying purely on the chemical and physical reactions of natural elements A Kassen s Bronze Pour series is created by pouring small amounts of hot liquid bronze directly into the water The bronze cools upon impact creating small un predictable and unexpected shapes which are scanned and cast on a larger scale in bronze The artists hands are notably absent in the shaping of the works They are ne cessarily abstract yet they retain a referential quality to them as we instantly try and place them and find recognisable sources for their imagery Reminiscent of modern sculptures Bronze Pour retains a kind of biomorphic form that adds to this ambiguity Last image A Kassen Riverman 2016 Permanently installed bronze pour sculptures at the Kistefos Museum Jevnaker NorwayPhoto credit Fr d ric Boudin

Jiayun Shi has created a large cheap Painting on Oil on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 In Landscape 9 2021 the artist activates the movement in the painting by dividing the picture plane into hemispheres overlapping in different directions The depicted scene seems like a landscape reconstructed by geometrical forms in blue black green and yellow patches while the motif of a spinning wheel on the lower left reverses the whole perspective in the presented picture Shi Jiayun regards seeing a recreation process to the perceived world and painting an interfering course to the reality on the account of painterly autonomy In her semi abstract painting the viewer sees the traces of representational elements but soon realizes the emerging scenery a pure glimpse of the secrecy that is against the objective orders

Liam Everett has created a small nominal Painting on Ink, oil, salt, ash and alcohol on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 This body of work was born out of the specific material limitations studio conditions and mundane interventions examined by the artist Everett s gestures when repeated and layered often lead to the erasure of the artist s hand entirely At other times however this process generates novel visual content of its own making Furthermore following his relocation from France to Northern California Everett began to regularly produce paintings in a landscape format What arises is the question of light more specifically how it is diffused reflected and exists as levels of clarity on both a formal and conceptual level As the environmental conditions of the studio and local environment shift these paintings slowly reveal themselves This embrace of instability and faith in extrinsic conditions situate this work at the very center of Everett s practice

Liam Everett has created a small cheap Painting on Ink, oil, salt, ash on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 In a selection of paintings atop screenprinted photographs conceptual parallels can be identified with the tradition of absurdist and agitprop theatre The inclusion of redundant gestures and spatial interventions a figure s face stuck to a table or a body replicated through the capabilities of the iPhone further expand Everett s quandaries into the nature of studio practice While these works may suggest consistency in their visual assemblage they are constructed so that each arises as a unique consequence of repetition and obstruction

Laura Lancaster has created a small   Painting on Acrylic on linen in the modern year of 2021.0  This image is low quality placeholder for the same workThis painting is a part of a recent body of work in which Laura Lancaster focuses on the reinterpretation of classical subjects involving the female figure In this work the artist continues her exploration of the tension between figuration and abstraction whilst focusing specifically on the portrayal of a sleeping figure The large brushstrokes and quick manipulation of paint blur the distinctions between the subject depicted and its context In this work a woman occupies the majority of a tightly cropped field of view Painted asleep she gives the viewer a sense that they are intruding however the removal of detailed visual information and a push in the direction of abstraction occludes the voyeurism conventionally associated with historical representation of the female figure to allow for a new perspective

Julian Opie has created a large expensive Mixed Media on Continuous computer animation on LED screen in the modern year of 2021.0 Born in 1958 in London Julian Opie is currently based in London Opie s distinctive formal language is instantly recognizable and reflects his artistic preoccupation with the idea of representation and the means by which images are perceived and understood In this LED film strangers drawn from the area of East London around Opie s studio plough through the streets in protective winter clothing In contrast to the vivid color works a naturalistic palette of colors emerges based on the clothes skin and hair of the individuals Diverging from the artist s familiar primary colors the muted tones of the figures reflect the wintry atmosphere enhanced by the black and white backgrounds The light passing through the black background of the lightbox emphasizes the color of each line Opie delineates the individuality of each fleeting passerby with keen observation which has always been central to his practice By depicting figures in the act of walking the artist captures the natural beauty of such ordinary movement into art

Thomas Arnolds has created a large nominal Painting on oil on canvas, 2 parts in the modern year of 2021.0 In his work Thomas Arnolds pursues the fundamental interest in constantly re exploring the possibilities and conditions of painting In doing so he develops a complex and at the same time consistent position that negotiates central issues of the medium in a coherent balance of at first glance contradicting designs abstraction vs figuration minimal vs gestural space vs image surface vs matter or hard edge vs free duct drawing the essence of his paintings lies in their surprising but always concise combination The visual vocabulary manifests itself as broadly as it is consistent interiors tool fragments and banal everyday objects meet crude bonsai arrangements architectural forms or the iconography of ancient column arrangements The correct representation of the selected image content is of secondary importance rather the motifs serve as placeholders or a pure occasion to step in front of the canvas at all Arnolds always works in series but deliberately does not develop his work linearly in clearly defined groups of works Based on an initial conceptual outlining what has already been introduced is mixed up in the process and is confronted with new technology or changed painterly access The fundamental meaning of matter color remains constant which Arnolds always knows how to use in its deep quality between materiality and volume between symbolism and metaphysical aspects Thomas Arnolds has created a set of instruments that are as precise as they can be used variably a free set of rules between intellect and gut feeling reflection and anarchy with which he pushes his oeuvre forward as a radical proposal on painting

Jiayun Shi has created a large cheap Painting on Oil on linen in the modern year of 2021.0 In Landscape 6 2021 the artist activates the movement in the painting by dividing the picture plane into hemisphere shapes overlapping in different directions The depicted scene seems like a landscape reconstructed by geometrical forms in blue black green and yellow patches while the motif of a spinning wheel on the lower left reverses the whole perspective in the presented picture Shi Jiayun regards seeing a recreation process to the perceived world and painting as an interfering course to the reality on the account of painterly autonomy In her semi abstract painting the viewer sees the traces of representational elements but soon realizes the emerging scenery a pure glimpse of the secrecy that is against the objective orders

Viktoria Binschtok has created a large cheap Photography on 2 digital c-prints, framed in the modern year of 2021.0 What do images communicate without any indication of the source location or the motivation behind what has been captured in them Viktoria Binschtok achieves just such a situation in her current body of work Cluster by confronting us with a wild mix of decontextualized components that construct a reality all its own immanent to the image and leaving the rest to our cognitive abilities Sometimes loudly sometimes quietly these visual clusters demonstrate their uncanny affinity based on the calculations of a machine and the incalculability of an artistic gesture Her precisely re staged photographs which always refer to already existing images refuse to be easily classified in standard genres by their artificial appearance cuts over lappings of several visual layers and elements that go beyond visual borders take up our screen based habits of vision and move them to an offline space Still life or snapshot professional or amateur photograph private or public all filters are turned off Networked visual information distracts us for a moment from our linear thinking in favor of a pleasurable engagement with a medium that for a long time now has not only been instrumentalized politically but has become a yardstick for all of us in our culture of instant evaluation It is the currency in the attention business always rising in value yet its subtext is an old one it could all be this way but it could also be entirely different 
Thomas Arnolds has created a medium cheap Painting on oil on canvas, 2 parts in the modern year of 2021.0 In his work Thomas Arnolds pursues the fundamental interest in constantly re exploring the possibilities and conditions of painting In doing so he develops a complex and at the same time consistent position that negotiates central issues of the medium in a coherent balance of at first glance contradicting designs abstraction vs figuration minimal vs gestural space vs image surface vs matter or hard edge vs free duct drawing the essence of his paintings lies in their surprising but always concise combination The visual vocabulary manifests itself as broadly as it is consistent interiors tool fragments and banal everyday objects meet crude bonsai arrangements architectural forms or the iconography of ancient column arrangements The correct representation of the selected image content is of secondary importance rather the motifs serve as placeholders or a pure occasion to step in front of the canvas at all Arnolds always works in series but deliberately does not develop his work linearly in clearly defined groups of works Based on an initial conceptual outlining what has already been introduced is mixed up in the process and is confronted with new technology or changed painterly access The fundamental meaning of matter color remains constant which Arnolds always knows how to use in its deep quality between materiality and volume between symbolism and metaphysical aspects Thomas Arnolds has created a set of instruments that are as precise as they can be used variably a free set of rules between intellect and gut feeling reflection and anarchy with which he pushes his oeuvre forward as a radical proposal on painting

Elizabeth Jaeger has created a small cheap Sculpture on ceramics in the modern year of 2021.0 With her sculptures ceramic objects and installations Elizabeth Jaeger San Francisco in 1988 lives in New York succeeds in exploring the relationship between corporeality perception and consciousness between sensation and emotion Often beginning with the feel of a personal experience something consciously lived through or an observation of a situation her works conjure a bigger picture with a phenomenological quality Her materials are simple but haptic and auratically charged clay ceramics plaster steel silk and glass show and preserve the imprint that the artist considers elementary and manual If earlier series by the artist focused on a direct engagement with the representation and socio cultural gaze on the female body and figuration Elizabeth Jaeger has recently been working with an ambivalent formal language all her own Borrowed from amorphous shapes and fantasy abstract forms based on flora and fauna are combined with strictly geometric steel constructions and thus given a psychological dimension they are physical objects and at the same time vessels for the soul and the world of thoughts In this way Jaeger opens a gaze on complex structures between organic objects made with the human hand and questions material and ideational binaries Her sculptures become organic viscerally treated material existential intellectual games on thingly truths and the possibility of embodying an emphatic and critical spirit Jaeger s objects and sculptures rely on the one hand on the dynamism of their materialities and the play between familiar form and abstract refraction on the other In the process they openly express their political content and their emotional urgency Their special quality lies in this very immediacy

Elliott Puckette has created a small expensive Mixed Media on gesso, kaolin and ink on board in the modern year of 2021.0 The elegant simplicity of Puckette s line belies its complex process With brisk confident gestures the artist etches pirouetting inlets into board washed with layers of gesso and ink The colored washes create distinctive atmospheres in each work brooding storm clouds of gray and tumultuous seas of dark purple Puckette uses a razor blade to draw her arcs carving out pathways instinctively with exquisite light touch Later she returns to deepen the furrows with cross hatching a labor intensive process that inherently slows the line subtracting it from the painting and delineating its negative space In recent bodies of work Puckette has developed her use of line by first rendering it three dimensions making ephemeral sculptures out of wire By translating the form of the maquette Puckette flattens and thus further abstracts the line As such the works capture a silhouette of their three dimensional references a fleeting snapshot of perspective Puckette s lines meander their terrain with no premeditated structure recalling the tenets of Tachisme the intuitive form of expression favored by European painters in the 1940s and 50s At the artist s Brooklyn studio photocopied works spanning the annals of art history are arranged on one wall an esoteric puzzle of visual references While the artist is typically reticent to explicate her works the blooming skies of John Constable and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo nod to a Romantic or sublime sensibility that is integral to Puckette s own work Elsewhere etchings by Albrecht D rer allude to the virtues of addition by means of subtraction mirrored in her practice Puckette s committed and meticulous study of this particular formal strategy has been lifelong Painting was considered in decline during her studies at Cooper Union but Puckette stood by her minimalist logic compelled by its potential It was always the line the artist has said I was completely compelled by the line from the get go It had more possibilities than form or shape or color This has remained Puckette s primary visual staple since the occasion of her first exhibition at Paul Kasmin Gallery in 1993 Born in 1967 in Lexington KY Elliott Puckette received her BFA from Cooper Union in New York in 1989 Her works are included in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art the New York Public Library the Fogg Museum and the Huntsville Museum of Art

Zehra Doğan has created a medium nominal Painting on Mixed media on fabric  in the modern year of 2021.0 The newspaper absorbs the colors and the printed materials tell ancient and true storiesThe Kurdish press has always been the archive of a painful history And today everyone can read in the pile of old newspapers stories of suffering more rarely of joyful moments I am also a journalist wrote Zehra I have often used the newspaper out of necessity but I also do so by specifically choosing archive reproductions It is a Kurdish press almost devoid of images on whose words I deposit my images These words also tell the story of Prison No 5 where I was detained They tell of the horror of his recent past mixed with my own impressions A print archive like a palette a notebook of drawings

Liam Everett has created a medium nominal Painting on ink, oil, sand on primed linen in the modern year of 2021.0 Liam Everett s abstract mixed media painting and sculpture result from a process of steadfast and repetitious application and erasure employing non traditional methods to apply and caustic substances to remove painstakingly developed layers of paint and composition Inspired by the dynamic alchemy of the natural environment in California this method makes plain the interactive properties of the substances on the canvas how they counteract preserve or react to one another In this way Everett s investigative procedure laser focused on the subtle behavior of his materials becomes akin to the scientific assaying of chemical and mineral substances in order to determine purity or the limits of stability In the studio the artist develops this process by imposing physical obstructions demanding exaggerated levels of adaptation and effort that recall the straight faced farce and gesturality of absurdist theatre Everett brings the body into the problem solving inherent in art making destabilizing and actualizing all at once The studio space then is akin to a rehearsal space in which progression and perpetual motion never quite reach a reliable resolution The toil of this circuitous working method is imbued in the work revealing itself on the canvas as a complex material and metaphysical depth The distillation of the studio s physical and ephemeral characteristics constitutes an important aspect of the artist s practice That which finds expression as work on canvas originates as the inherent dimensions of the structure of the space the proportion of a window direction of its light and the makeshift tools found nearby or inside Time spent in the studio corralling these native elements and learning their individual insistences on translation through the work acts as Everett s primary vehicle for developing its direction In this way what remains is an indexical record of the artist s labor and practice Everett has previously collaborated with choreographers and dancers during major exhibitions to activate the motion inherent in the works For the artist s 2017 installation at SFMOMA Everett invited dance partners for performative actions twice weekly incorporating a sculptural staging element that further developed his investigations into the influence of emotive environments Born in 1973 in Rochester New York Liam Everett lives and works in Northern California His work has been included in exhibitions at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art the Biennale of Painting Museum Dhondt Dhaenens Deurle Belgium U C Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts San Francisco Everett is the recipient of the SECA Art Award at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 2017 the Richard Diebenkorn Teaching Fellowship at the San Francisco Art Institute 2013 and the San Francisco Artadia Award 2013 Everett s work is included in significant international public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Dallas Museum of Art Mus e des Beaux Arts Rennes France Fondation Carmignac Paris Kistefos Museum Jevnaker Norway and U C Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive

Miquel Barceló has created a large expensive Sculpture on Ceramic in the modern year of 2019.0 In Botanica Rossa 2019 21 leaves unfurl from a cracked and crooked vase swathed in visceral drips of red paint The spiral composition as well as the gestural application of paint create a sense of movement that animates the work Taking inspiration from the flora surrounding the artist s studio in Mallorca the vessel seems to transform before our eyes into a plant which itself appears to take on human or creature like qualities This idea of metamorphosis is fundamental to the artist who recently created original watercolours for a new edition of Franz Kafka s La M tamorphose first published in 1915 and is made manifest in his ceramics which undergo an alchemical change when fired in the kiln The malleable clay becomes hardened brittle and may even crack due to the high heat They are often fissured and I accept the cracks with joy as part of the work

Pablo Picasso has created a small expensive Work on Paper on Ink wash on paper in the classic year of 1970.0 The theme of the painter and his model has been fundamental in Western art history Pierre Georgel compares the theme of the painter and his model in Picasso s oeuvre with the history of the artist s studio and notes the following Picasso in the variations of his last twenty years feigns to turn his comic verve against himself and his own activity this little gnome who multiplies himself under so many masks in the face of the immutable and passive beauty of the model is the one who leads the play of this ever new comedy the all powerful demiurge whose name symbolises in the mythology of the 20th Century the unheard of prestige of the artist Pierre Georgel La peinture dans la peinture exh cat Dijon Mus e des Beaux Arts 1982 Translated from the French From 1963 Picasso returned to the theme of the painter and his model which had been present in his work since his illustration of Balzac s short story Chef d oeuvre inconnu The Unknown Masterpiece in 1926 These paintings portray a painter with a palette and brushes standing in front of a canvas usually seen from the side and a naked model either sitting or reclining The present work was conceived in 1970 during the last years of Picasso s life It was amid this tumultuous time when he incorporated a mixture of styles into his body of work The motif of the female nude fascinated Picasso In the present work he accentuates the curves of the model s body contrasting with the quasi abstract figure of the painter Picasso presents the artist as both creator and voyeur We re here to observe the creative process rather than the finished product so we re viewing a work in progress

Fernando Zóbel has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil on canvas in the classic year of 1974.0 The monochrome in Z bel stems from a struggle with the grid that manifests itself as a hint of a frame to contain the gesture or image of dispersed pigment What complicates this delicate poetics is its difficult if not impossible technique The artist experiments with the hypodermic needle which dispenses solvent and paint He reflects on it with irony stating I was using a hypodermic syringe which is one of the least expressive instruments possible The only advantage a hypodermic has is that it permits you to make an extremely long thin line in oil But it is very hard to get any beauty or expressivity out of it Here the tension between poiesis and techne surfaces in a very lively way and elaborates in thelong term as a tension between the autonomy of the aesthetic and the ecology of the material To the degree that it frustrates both autographic labor and the automatism of instrument Z bel s response to the grid fulfills the promise of theself renewing modern Within the grid the monochrome however refuses to be diminished It tries to slip away or to seep through In this regard the interlocutor Raymundo Albano s remarkable work titled The Grid Escape 1978 whichconsists of pages of tracing paper on which the artist writes in longhand may prove salient if only because it tells the tale of a modernist artist s travail against the grid In the vein of Icarus Albano calls it a parable If the monochrome and the grid are intuited in alternation a third modernist cipher may be anticipated And this is the stain which cites a range of interests It is phenomenologically a kind of bleeding Stylistically it is patina In terms ofeffect it is lyrical in its modulation a cognate of translucence that reveals itself in many Philippine cultural forms like the lantern or the shell window In the oeuvre of the Filipino artist Benedicto Cabrera the stain within the grid alludes to the colonial archive which he recovers to annotate a colonial present In Z bel s conception the line that complicates the agency of the grid and inevitably dissipates into the atmosphere of a painting Saeta Arrow which is as well a song of human passion is the beginning of the potential objecthood of these same elements Patrick D Flores Memory of Qualities in Z bel Chillida Criscrossing paths Barcelona 2019 p 137

Tomás Saraceno has created a large expensive Sculpture on powder-coated stainless steel, metal wire, mirror panels in the modern year of 2019.0 Foam SB 18 2019 by Tom s Saraceno is a suspended sculpture of stainless steel wire and mirrored panels that derives its form from foam highlighting both the static nature of its metal structure and the organic order of natural systems Curvilinear metal segments are here assembled to mimic soap bubbles or flared rain filled clouds and coalesce in a cluster that simultaneously appears complexly systematically ordered and highly irregular This enigmatic composition invites inquiry into and exploration of Saraceno s magnified representation of an organic phenomenon bringing to mind the geometry that serves as the building blocks for our environments Meanwhile the mirrored panels at the junctions of this wireframe network hint at the fluidity of boundaries and the interdependence of systems and their surroundings inviting consideration of alternate modes of existence within local environs

Yuki Katsura has created a medium cheap Mixed Media on cork on board in the classic year of 1979.0 Cork is a recurring material in Katsura s work In 1935 Katsura witnessed a bird s eye view of roof tiles and was greatly impacted by the way the pattern seemed to spread outwards endlessly Inspired she created a work made from cork scraps that she picked up from behind a factory tightly squeezing them onto a panel This became the catalyst for a continued relationship with the material In 1979 when this work was created a similar work using cork was shown at her solo exhibition at Tokyo Gallery Within these assemblages of haphazardly arranged manmade corks one may find commonalities between the inspiration the artist received from the roof tiles before World War II and the minimal art that developed mainly in the United States after World War II

Yuki Katsura has created a large expensive Painting on oil and paper on canvas in the classic year of 1961.0 Yuki Katsura started making collages with handmade Japanese washi paper after moving to New York in 1960 Following a long five year journey across Paris various European countries and Africa she finally settled in New York City Where she found a large sunny place to establish her studio Although she only stayed at the studio until 1961 she created many abstract paintings there using a technique wherein she applied colored Japanese washi paper on the canvas Katsura continued to utilize her collage techniques from 1930s but unlike her works from that period This Work 1961 communicates the impact that Abstract Expressionism had on the artist This work is an example of a transitional stage in Katsura s works when legs began to grow out of the central rectangular and circular wash paper forms pasted onto the canvas 
Yuki Katsura has created a small nominal Painting on oil on canvas in the classic year of 1938.0 Yuki Katsura began painting at an early age first in Nihonga Japanese style painting and then switched to oil painting for a further search of free expressions Whilst oil painting was seen as something that men would do this choice was made simply because she wanted to express her feelings in the most natural way In 1935 she held a solo exhibition of collage works at a gallery in Ginza At that time few artists knew the meaning of the term collage and even Katsura herself later knew that there was a name to her experimental practices Katsura s innovative style in which she depicts familiar motifs that are close at hand from an unprecedented perspective and distance got many reactions by the surrounding artists She then became the founding member of the Kyushitsukai Ninth Room Association of the Nika kai which was a group of artists who led the postwar avant garde art movement This work was painted at around the same time The texture of the fallen leaves painted in oil the collage like white margins combined abruptly and without perspective and the delicate cracks painted in those margins all function to visually bewilder the viewer revealing the artist s unique style Today this piece is one of the most valuable examples of pre war artwork

Urs Lüthi has created a large nominal Prints & Multiples on ultrachromeprint with plexiglass and aluminum  in the modern year of 2022.0 The latest series Selfportrait Transmission Error by Urs L thi shows embodied images At first sight it is not easy to find a human figure in the black and white print but in fact the original motif was a bust of the artist The photograph of the statue was then digitally reworked to create the effect of the figure being pulled through a bottomless abyss or twister In addition the image is layered with grid lines reminiscent of surveillance cameras L thi states that this is a deliberate means of breaking the complacency and aura of black and white photography Also the large format pulls the viewer into a black hole that raises questions about man in the cosmos The artist possibly records those decisive moments when the thinking being discovers that he is not lonely or lost in the lands of the universe but that there reigns a universal flow One could dare say that man is not as he has believed for so long the world s fixed center but the axis and apex of creation and is that not much more beautiful Again the general character of these self portraits shows that it is always a single person who is given the feelings of the worldwide cobwebs and while we may dismiss them as a personal affair it is and always will be a general experience too

Urs Lüthi has created a large nominal Prints & Multiples on ultrachromeprint, acrylic in the classic year of 2016.0 Urs L thi has provided himself with a corporate identity by turning his person into a brand label authenticated by the image of his own head in profile In this age of anonymity and excessive selfie culture the artist skillfully turns himself into a product In this case the product takes the form of a digitally generated industrially manufactured gloss sealed image which is nevertheless unmistakably a work of art Urs L thi initiated the ongoing project of self portraits in the seventies by taking his subjective world of experiences as the paradigm for his creations Each self portrait whether in print or sculpture invites one into an encounter of romantic irony Herein the artist submits a self consciousness that questions given traditions By exaggerating certain details he highlights its fictional illusion and exposes its irony The artist offers himself in a kind of self mockery while playfully bestowing freedom from the limits of conventions

Urs Lüthi has created a small nominal Video/Film on video, monitor in the modern year of 2020.0 The presentation of his person does not serve as a form of narcissism instead it acts as a proxy for the human figure itself In the video Shame the head is free of personal or stylistic references and becomes an abstract authority of the human mind and its sensations His self portrait becomes a generalistic symbol of intellectual engagement with human emotions The video shows a film still of the artist s upper body for xx minutes while the face blushes and grows pale again Portrayed is the feeling of shame which is a highly taboo feeling When one feels ashamed the face often turns pink suddenly one feels exposed to the gaze of others and one freezes But what personal need arises from shame Or in what interaction can shame be triggered The gaze of the other reveals an inadequacy in the subject and brings it into focus The feeling of shame has always been a philosophically highly studied topic because it is often evoked in connection with envy Also it expresses the quest for invulnerability and longs for appeasement or even forgiveness Aristotle called shame an affect because it is brought about unintentionally by external factors and is thus bound to moral principles Nietzsche also addresses shame in his moral critique in which he argues against moral authorities social conventions and normative shaming mechanisms In Die fr hliche Wissenschaft Nietzsche writes What is the seal of achieved freedom To no longer be ashamed of oneself Friedrich Nietzsche Works in Three Volumes Munich 1954 vol 2 pp 160 161

Tsuyoshi Maekawa has created a medium expensive Painting on Oil and burlap on canvas in the classic year of 1964.0 As is common to the art made by all Gutai artists Tsuyoshi Maekawa s practice entails an authentic and personal approach with great respect for the material of choice in all its purity The tactility he manages to convey is deeply moving For members of the Gutai Art Association which existed over a period of eighteen years from 1954 1972 matter was the true vehicle of expression It represented nothing other than itself The ego of the artist never prevailed over it The artist was at the behest of the medium Following the true Gutai spirit Maekawa places himself fully at the service of matter Raw gritty tough chosen from life the weft and weave of burlap are his medium of choice As anyone who has ever draped a piece of material knows the way a piece of fabric falls or folds in a certain disposition is difficult to predict It demands an active first hand involvement The way it stretches and pleats carries the authenticity of presence These works cannot possibly be reproduced As such Maekawa s works stand out from the time in which they evolve They re unique and specific With Maekawa the artist uses his hands mind and eyes combined to actively confront the material The traces expressed in the coarse fabric whether it s been mounted on canvas squared ripped folded creased painted over tied together or glued are dependent on the various decisions the artist makes when he is caught in the midst of creative flow The result of that process is what viewers are privileged to experience when examining the work Every splash or fold was the result of an active decision The brute force of the momentum it expresses draws the viewer in and taps into the multiplicity of options the work proposes Maekawa s art travels down many roads It s an art of possibility 
Tsuyoshi Maekawa has created a medium nominal Painting on Sewn hemp cloth, oil in the classic year of 2018.0 From the early 1950s onwards Tsuyoshi Maekawa incorporated the use of burlap a woven raw fabric composed of plant hemp fibres that s mainly used for bags for rice and grain in his artistic practice He convinced the Gutai co founder Jiro Yoshihara of his abilities in 1959 but only formally joined the Gutai Art Association in 1962 In the Gutai Art Manifesto Yoshihara wrote Matter is never assimilated by the spirit The spirit never dominates matter If one leaves matter as it is and simply presents it as matter it begins to tell us something and even cries out Bringing matter to life is a way of bringing the spirit to life After the dissolution of Gutai in 1972 Maekawa s style as an artist became lighter and more refined He intentionally combined cloth with different tactility and other qualities such as hemp cloth and cotton With a sewing machine a device Maekawa had in his parental home or by using tucked seams fine slender convex patterns were created Maekawa later again gave a greater role to colour in his work in which the entire sewn burlap canvasses were painted in monochromatic hues Burlap bags which already had a function as a means of packaging or transport again forced Maekawa to think about possibilities with already printed fabrics as a ready made The compositional simplicity basic reliefs and pliable looking structures however build on the calm subtlety that Maekawa brought to his practice With the use of glistening oil or varnish pressed directly from tubes to mark certain areas of the surface and the sometimes wrinkled and twisted waveforms Maekawa reminds us of his urge to create always looking for new ways to express himself
